SUPP. HYMN 2

I'll praise my Maker while I've breath,
And when my voice is lost in death,
Praise shall employ my nobler powers;
My days of praise shall never be past
While life, and thought, and being last,
Or immortality endures.

Happy the man whose hopes rely
On Israel's God He made the sky,
And earth, and sea, with all their train;
His truth forever stands secure,
He saves the oppressed, He feeds the poor,
And none shall find His promise vain.

The Lord pours eyesight on the blind,
The Lord supports the fainting mind,
He sends the laboring conscience peace;
He helps the stranger in distress,
The widow, and the fatherless,
And grants the prisoner sweet release.

I'll praise Him while He lends me breath,
And when my voice is lost in death,
Praise shall employ my nobler powers;
My days of praise shall ne’er be past
While life, and thought, and being last,
Or immortality endures.
