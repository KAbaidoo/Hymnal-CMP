SUPP. HYMN 49

Jesus, in Thy dear Sacrament
Thy Cross I cannot see,
But the Crucified is offered there
And He was slain for me.

Jesus, in Thy dear Sacrament
Thy flesh I cannot see,
But that flesh is given to be our food,
And it was scourged for me.

Jesus, in Thy dear Sacrament
Thy blood I cannot see,
But the Chalice glows with those red drops
On Calvary shed for me.

Jesus, in Thy Sacrament
Thy face I cannot see,
But angels there behold the brow
Thorn-crowned for love of me.

Jesus, in Thy Sacrament
Thy heart I cannot see,
But that fiery heart is prisoned there,
And it was pierced for me.

Jesus, my Maker and my God,
Thy Godhead none may see,
But Thou art present, God and man,
In Thy Sacrament with me.
