SUPP. HYMN 42

See, amid the winter's snow,
Born for us on earth below,
See, the Lamb of God appears,
Promised from eternal years.

Chorus:
Hail, Thou ever blessed morn!
Hail, redemption's happy dawn!
Sing through all Jerusalem:
Christ is born in Bethlehem!

Lo, within a manger lies
He who built the starry skies;
He who, throned in height sublime,
Sits amid the cherubim.

Say, ye holy shepherds, say
What your joyful news today?
Wherefore have ye left your sheep
On the lonely mountain steep?

As we watched at dead of night,
Lo, we saw a wondrous light;
Angels singing 'Peace on earth,'
Told us of the Saviour's birth.
