SUPP. HYMN 50

Jesus is here with us
Jesus is here!
Earth fades in mist away,
Heaven's gate is near.
Doubt not, sad heart, nor fear,
For thy dear Lord is here.
Jesus is here!

First fruits of Bethlehem,
Thee we adore:
God in the House of Bread
Tarries once more.
Sinful man's sins to bear,
The Lamb of God is here
Jesus is here!

Jesus here pleads for man,
Pardon to win;
One perfect sacrifice
Offered for sin.
So when life's storm blows drear,
We know that Thou art near
Jesus is here!
