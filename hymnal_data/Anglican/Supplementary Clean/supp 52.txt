SUPP. HYMN 52

Sweet Sacrament divine,
Hid in Thy earthly home,
Lo! round Thy lowly shrine,
With suppliant hearts we come.
Jesus, to Thee our voices raise
In songs of love and heartfelt praise
Sweet Sacrament divine!

Sweet Sacrament of peace,
Dear home for every heart,
Where restless yearnings cease,
And sorrows all depart.
There in Thine ear, all trustfully,
We tell our tale of misery
Sweet Sacrament of peace!

Sweet Sacrament of rest,
Ark from the ocean's roar,
Within Thy shelter blest
Soon may we reach the shore.
Save us, for still the tempest raves
Save, lest we sink beneath the waves
Sweet Sacrament of rest!

Sweet Sacrament divine,
Earth's Light and Jubilee,
In Thy far depths doth shine
Thy Godhead's majesty.
Sweet Light, so shine on us, we pray,
That earthly joys may fade away
Sweet Sacrament divine
