SUPP. HYMN 13

Heal us, Immanuel; hear our prayer
We wait to feel Thy touch.
Deep-wounded souls to Thee repair,
And, Saviour, we are such.

Our faith is feeble, we confess;
We faintly trust Thy word.
But wilt Thou pity us the less?
Be that far from Thee, Lord.

Remember him who once applied
With trembling for relief:
Lord, I believe," with tears he cried,
O help my unbelief.”

She too who touched Thee in the press
And healing virtue stole,
Was answered, "Daughter, go in peace,
Thy faith hath made thee whole.”
