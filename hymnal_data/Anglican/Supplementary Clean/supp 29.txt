SUPP. HYMN 29

Master, speak! Thy servant heareth,
Waiting for Thy gracious word,
Longing for Thy voice that cheereth
Master, let it now be heard!
I am listening, Lord, for Thee;
What hast Thou to say to me?

Often through my heart is pealing
Many another voice than Thine
Many an unwilled echo stealing
From the walls of this Thy shrine.
Let Thy longed-for accents fall:
Master, speak! and silence all.

Master, speak! and make me ready,
When Thy voice is truly heard,
With obedience glad and steady,
Still to follow every word.
I am listening, Lord, for Thee
Master, speak! oh, speak to me.

Speak to me by name, O Master,
Let me know it is to me;
Speak, that I may follow faster,
With a step more firm and free,
Where the Shepherd leads the flock,
In the shadow of the Rock.
