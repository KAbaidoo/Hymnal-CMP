SUPP. HYMN 53

There is a fountain filled with Blood,
Drawn from Emmanuel's veins,
And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,
Lose all their guilty stains.

I do believe, I will believe
That Jesus died for me
That on the Cross He shed His Blood
From sin to set me free.

The dying thief rejoiced to see
That fountain in his day,
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away.

Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious Blood
Shall never lose its power,
Till all the ransomed Church of God
Be saved, to sin no more.

E'er since by faith I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die.

Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
I'll sing Thy power to save,
When this poor lisping, stammering tongue
Lies silent in the grave.
