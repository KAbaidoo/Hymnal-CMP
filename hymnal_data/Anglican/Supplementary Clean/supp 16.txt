SUPP. HYMN 16

I bring my sins to Thee
The sins I cannot count
That all may cleansèd be
In Thy once-opened Fount.
I bring them, Saviour, all to Thee
The burden is too great for me.

My heart to Thee I bring
The heart I cannot read,
A faithless, wandering thing,
An evil heart indeed.
I bring it, Saviour, now to Thee
That fixed and faithful it may be.

To Thee I bring my care
The care I cannot flee.
Thou wilt not only share,
But bear it all for me.
O loving Saviour, now to Thee
I bring the load that wearies me.

I bring my grief to Thee
The grief I cannot tell.
No words shall needed be,
Thou knowest all so well.
I bring the sorrow laid on me
O suffering Saviour, now to Thee.
