SUPP. HYMN 27

Who is He, in yonder stall,
At whose feet the shepherds fall?

Chorus:
Tis the Lord! O wondrous story!
Tis the Lord, the King of Glory!
At His feet we humbly fall
Crown Him, crown Him Lord of all!

Who is He, in yonder cot,
Bending to His toilsome lot?

Who is He, in deep distress,
Fasting in the wilderness?

Who is He that stands and weeps
At the grave where Lazarus sleeps?

Lo, at midnight, who is He,
Prays in dark Gethsemane?

Who is He, in Calvary's throes,
Asks for blessings on His foes?

Who is He that from the grave
Comes to heal and help and save?

Who is He, that from His throne
Rules through all the worlds alone?
