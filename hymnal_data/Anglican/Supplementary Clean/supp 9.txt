SUPP. HYMN 9

Father, I dare believe
Thee merciful and true;
Thou wilt my guilty soul forgive,
My fallen soul renew.

Come then, for Jesus' sake,
And bid my heart be clean,
And end of all my troubles make
An end of all my sin.

I will, through grace I will!
I do return to Thee.
Take, empty it, O Lord, and fill
My heart with purity.

For power I feebly pray:
Thy kingdom now restore.
Today, while it is called today,
I shall not sin no more.
