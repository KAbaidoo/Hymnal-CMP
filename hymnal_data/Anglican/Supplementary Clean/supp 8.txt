SUPP. HYMN 8

What means this eager, anxious throng
Which moves with busy haste along
Those wondrous gatherings day by day?
What means this strange commotion, pray?
In accents hushed the throng reply:
Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.

Who is this Jesus? Why should He
The city move so mightily?
A passing Stranger has He skill
To move the multitude at will?
Again the stirring tones reply:
Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.

Jesus tis He who once below
Man's pathway trod 'mid pain and woe;
And burdened ones, where'er He came,
Brought out their sick, and deaf, and lame.
The blind rejoiced to hear the cry:
Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.

Again He comes from place to place,
His holy footprints we can trace;
He passeth at our threshold nay,
He enters, condescends to stay.
Shall we not gladly raise the cry:
Jesus of Nazareth passeth by
