SUPP. HYMN 1

JESUS, my SAVIOUR, Brother, Friend, 
On whom I cast my every care, 
On whom for all things I depend, 
Inspire, and then accept, my prayer

If I have tasted of Thy grace, 
The grace that sure salvation brings, 
If with me now Thy SPIRIT stays, 
And hovering hides me in His wings

Still let Him with my weakness stay, 
Nor for a moment's space depart, 
Evil and danger turn away, 
And keep till He renews my heart

When to the right or left I stray, 
His voice behind me may I hear, 
Return, and walk in CHRIST Thy way, 
Fly back to CHRIST, for sin is near.
