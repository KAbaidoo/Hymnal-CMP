SUPP. HYMN 40

When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,
When sorrows like sea billows roll,
Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,
It is well, it is well with my soul.

Chorus:
It is well, with my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul.

Though Satan should buffet,
Though trials should come,
Let this blest assurance control:
That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate,
And hath shed His own blood for my soul.

My sin oh, the bliss of this glorious thought
My sin not in part, but the whole
Is nailed to the Cross, and I bear it no more:
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

Chorus:
It is well… with my soul…
It is well, it is well with my soul.

But, Lord, tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait
The sky, not the grave, is our goal;
Oh, trump of the angel! Oh, voice of the Lord!
Blessed hope! Blessed rest of my soul.

And, Lord, haste the day when the faith shall be sight,
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll,
The trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend
Even so, it is well with my soul.
