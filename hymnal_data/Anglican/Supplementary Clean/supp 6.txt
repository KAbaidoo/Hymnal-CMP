SUPP. HYMN 6

All things praise Thee, Lord most high,
Heaven and earth and sea and sky;
All were for Thy glory made,
That Thy greatness thus displayed
Should all worship bring to Thee.
All things praise Thee; Lord, may we.

All things praise Thee; night to night
Sings in silent hymns of light.
All things praise Thee; day to day
Chants Thy power in burning ray.
Time and space are praising Thee;
All things praise Thee; Lord, may we.

All things praise Thee; round her zones,
Earth, with her ten thousand tones,
Rolls a ceaseless choral strain
Roaring wind and deep-voiced main,
Leaf and insect, bird and bee,
All things praise Thee; Lord, may we.

All things praise Thee high and low,
Rain and dew and seven-hued bow,
Crimson sunset, fleecy cloud,
Rippling stream and tempest loud;
Summer, winter, all to Thee
Glory render; Lord, may we.
