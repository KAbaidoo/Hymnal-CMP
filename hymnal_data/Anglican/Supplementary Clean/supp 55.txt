SUPP. HYMN 55

Yes, Heaven is the prize
My soul shall strive to gain.
One glimpse of Paradise
Repays a life of pain.

Tis Heaven yes, Heaven; yes, Heaven is the prize!
Tis Heaven tis Heaven; yes, Heaven is the prize!

Yes, Heaven is the prize!
My soul, oh think of this:
All earthly joys despise
For such a crown of bliss.
Tis Heaven, etc.

Yes, Heaven is the prize!
When sorrows press around,
Look up beyond the skies,
Where hope and strength are found.
Tis Heaven, etc.

Yes, Heaven is the prize!
Oh, tis not hard to gain
He surely wins who tries,
For hope can conquer pain.
Tis Heaven, etc.

Yes, Heaven is the prize!
The strife will soon be past.
Faint not, but raise your eyes
And struggle to the last.
Tis Heaven, etc.

Yes, Heaven is the prize!
Faith shows the crown to gain,
Hope lights the way and dies,
But love will still remain.
Tis Heaven, etc.

Yes, Heaven is the prize!
Too much cannot be given;
And he alone is wise
Who gives up all for Heaven.
Tis Heaven, etc.

Yes, Heaven is the prize!
Death opens wide the door,
And then the spirit flies
To God for evermore.
Tis Heaven yes, Heaven; yes, Heaven is the prize!
