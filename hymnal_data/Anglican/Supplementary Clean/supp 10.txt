SUPP. HYMN 10

Dear Lord and Father of mankind,
Forgive our foolish ways;
Re-clothe us in our rightful mind
In purer lives Thy service find,
In deeper reverence, praise.

In simple trust, like theirs who heard
Beside the Syrian sea
The gracious calling of the Lord,
Let us, like them, without a word,
Rise up and follow Thee.

O Sabbath rest by Galilee,
O calm of hills above,
Where Jesus knelt to share with Thee
The silence of eternity,
Interpreted by love.

Breathe through the heats of our desire
Thy coolness and Thy balm;
Let sense be dumb, let flesh retire;
Speak through the earthquake, wind, and fire
O still, small voice of calm.
