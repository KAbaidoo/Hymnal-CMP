SUPP. HYMN 12

Go, labour on; spend and be spent
Thy joy to do the Father's will.
It is the way the Master went;
Should not the servant tread it still?

Go, labour on; 'tis not for nought
Thy earthly loss is heavenly gain.
Men heed thee, love thee, praise thee not;
The Master praises what are men?

Go, labour on; while it is day,
The world's dark night is hastening on.
Speed, speed thy work! Cast sloth away!
It is not thus that souls are won.

Men die in darkness at your side,
Without a hope to cheer the tomb.
Take up the torch and wave it wide
The torch that lights time's thickest gloom.
