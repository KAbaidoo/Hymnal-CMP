SUPP. HYMN 21

Pass me not, O loving Saviour,
Hear my humble cry;
And while others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.

Chorus:
Saviour! Saviour!
Hear my humble cry;
And while others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.

Let me at the Throne of mercy
Find a sweet relief,
Kneeling there in deep contrition,
Help my unbelief.

Trusting only in Thy merit,
Would I seek Thy face;
Heal my wounded, broken spirit,
Save me by Thy grace.
