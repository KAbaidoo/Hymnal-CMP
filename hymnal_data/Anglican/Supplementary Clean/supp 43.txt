SUPP. HYMN 43

There shall be showers of blessing
This is the promise of love;
There shall be seasons refreshing,
Sent from the Saviour above.

Chorus:
Showers of blessing, showers of blessing we need;
Mercy drops round us are falling,
But for the showers we plead.

There shall be showers of blessing,
Send them upon us, O Lord!
Grant to us now a refreshing
Come and now honour Thy Word.

There shall be showers of blessing
Oh, that today they might fall!
Now as to God we're confessing,
Now as on Jesus we call.
