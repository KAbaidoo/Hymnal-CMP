SUPP. HYMN 48

Ere we leave Thine altar, Lord,
Where Thy Son we have adored,
Let our thanks again arise
For this holy sacrifice.

And if thoughts have entered in
Which have mixed our prayers with sin,
Let Thy Son's pure blood and grace
All the sinfulness efface.

Make us, Lord, the whole day through
Love the good and speak the true,
Work our work with all our might,
Stand up bravely for the right.

Sweet it is to worship here!
Soon may that bright day appear
When Thy glory we shall see,
And unhindered worship Thee.
