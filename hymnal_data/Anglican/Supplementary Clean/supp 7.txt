SUPP. HYMN 7

On Calvary's Tree, He suffered for me,
The just for the unjust, that I might be free;
His grace is abundant, His love divine
Oh, wonder of wonders, the Saviour is mine!

The Cross that He bore has saved us all,
And washed away all sins that tarnished us.
This great sacrifice of the Lord Divine
Oh, wonder of wonders, this Saviour is mine.

His death on the Cross atones for our sins,
The sins of the world that He taketh away.
He conquered the grave, supremely divine
Oh, wonder of wonders, this Saviour is mine.

Death has no more power o'er the Saviour dear
The Saviour, Christ Jesus, who rose from the grave.
Thus sing "Alleluias" to Christ Divine
Oh, wonder of wonders, this Saviour is mine.
