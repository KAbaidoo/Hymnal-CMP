SUPP. HYMN 54

Ye who own the faith of Jesus,
Sing the wonders that were done,
When the love of God the Father
O’er our sin the victory won,
When He made the Virgin Mary
Mother of His only Son.
Hail Mary, full of grace.

Blessed were the chosen people
Out of whom the Lord did come,
Blessed was the land of promise
Fashioned for His earthly home.
But more blessed was the Mother
She who bare Him in her womb.

Wherefore let all faithful people
Tell the honour of her name;
Let the Church in her foreshadowed
Part in her thanksgiving claim.
What Christ's Mother sang in gladness,
Let Christ's people sing the same.

Let us weave our supplications
She with us and we with her
For the strengthening of the faithful,
For each faithful worshipper;
For the doubting, for the sinful,
For each heedless wanderer.

May the Mother's intercessions
On our homes a blessing win,
That the children all be prospered
Strong and fair and pure within
Following our Lord's own footsteps,
Firm in faith and free from sin.

For the sick and for the aged,
For our dear ones far away,
For the hearts that mourn in secret,
All who need our prayers today,
For the faithful gone before us
May the Holy Virgin pray.

Praise, O Mary, praise the Father,
Praise thy Saviour and thy Son,
Praise the everlasting Spirit
Who hath made thee ark and throne.
O'er all creatures high exalted
Lowly praise the Three in One.
