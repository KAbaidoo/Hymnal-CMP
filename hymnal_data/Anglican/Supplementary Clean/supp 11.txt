SUPP. HYMN 11

They who tread the path of labour
Follow where My feet have trod;
They who work without complaining
Do the holy will of God.

Nevermore thou needest seek Me;
I am with thee everywhere
Raise the stone, and thou shalt find Me;
Cleave the wood, and I am there.

Where the many toil together,
There am I among My own;
Where the tired workman sleepeth,
There am I with him alone.

I, the Peace that passeth knowledge,
Dwell amid the daily strife;
I, the Bread of heaven, am broken
In the sacrament of life.

Every task, however simple,
Sets the soul that does it free;
Every deed of love and mercy
Done to man is done to Me.

Nevermore thou needest seek Me;
I am with thee everywhere
Raise the stone, and thou shalt find Me;
Cleave the wood, and I am there.
