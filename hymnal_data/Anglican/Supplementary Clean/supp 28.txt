SUPP. HYMN 28

Pray without ceasing, pray
Your Captain gives the word;
His summons cheerfully obey,
And call upon the Lord.
To God in every want
In instant prayer display;
Pray always, pray, and never faint
Pray, without ceasing, pray.

In fellowship alone,
To God with faith draw near;
Approach His courts, besiege His throne,
With all the power of prayer.
Go to His temple go,
Nor from His altar move;
Let every house His worship know,
And every heart His love.

Pour out your souls to God,
And bow them with your knees;
And spread your hearts and hands abroad,
And pray for Zion's peace.
Your guides and brethren bear
Forever on your mind;
Extend the arms of mighty prayer,
Embracing all mankind.

From strength to strength go on,
Wrestle and fight and pray;
Tread all the powers of darkness down,
And win the well-fought day.
Still let the Spirit cry
In all His soldiers, "Come!"
Till Christ the Lord descend on high
And take the conquerors home.
