HYMN 376 WAR

O GOD of love, O King of peace, Make wars throughout the world to cease;
The wrath of sinful man restrain, Give peace, O GOD, give peace again.

Remember, LORD, Thy works of old, The wonders that our FATHERs told, Remember
not our sins dark stain, Give peace, O GOD, give peace again.

Whom shall we trust but Thee, O
LORD?
Where rest but on Thy faithful Word?
None ever called on Thee in vain, Give peace, O GOD, give peace again.
