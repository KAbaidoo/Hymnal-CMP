HYMN 295

The strain upraise of joy and praise, Alleluia!
To the glory of their King let the ransom'd people sing Alleluia!

And the choirs that dwell on high
Swell the chorus in the sky, Alleluia!
Ye, through the fields of Paradise that roam,
Ye blessed ones, repeat through that bright home
Alleluia!

Ye planets glittering on your heavenly way,
Ye shining constellations join and say
Alleluia!
Ye clouds that onward sweep, Ye winds on pinions light,
Ye thunders, echoing loud and deep, Ye lightning, wildly bright,
In sweet consent unite your Alleluia!

First let the birds, with painted plumage gay,
Exalt their great Creator's praise, and say
Alleluia!

Here let the mountains thunder forth sonorous
Alleluia!

There let the valleys singing gentler chorus
Alleluia!

Thou jubilant abyss...ocean, cry Alleluia!

To GOD, who all creation made, The frequent hymn be duly paid, Alleluia!

This the strain, the eternal strain, The LORD of all things loves, Alleluia!

This the Song, the heavenly Song, That CHRIST Himself approves, Alleluia!

Wherefore we sing, both heart and voice awaking,
Alleluia!

And children's voices echo, answer making,
Alleluia!

Now from all men be outpour'd Alleluia to the LORD;
With Alleluia evermore The SON and SPIRIT we adore.

Praise be done to the THREE in ONE, Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
