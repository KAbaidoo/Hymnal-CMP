HYMN 109

Sweet the moments, rich in blessing,
Which before the cross I spend,
Life, and health and peace possessing
From the sinner’s dying friend.

Here I rest, forever viewing
Mercy poured in streams of blood;
Precious drops, my soul bedewing,
Plead and claim my peace with GOD.

Truly blessed is the station
Low before His cross to lie,
Whilst I see Divine compassion
Beaming in His languid eye.

LORD, in ceaseless contemplation
Fix my thankful heart on Thee,
Till I taste Thy full salvation,
And thine unveiled glory see.
