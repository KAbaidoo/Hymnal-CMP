HYMN 277

Nearer, my GOD, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee;
E’en Though it be a cross
That raiseth me; Still all my song shall be,
Nearer, my GOD, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee.

Though, like the wanderer,
The sun gone down, Darkness comes over me,
My rest a stone; Yet in my dreams I’d be
Nearer, my GOD, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee,
There let my way appear
Steps unto Heav’n, All that Thou sendest me
In mercy given, Angels to beckon me
Nearer, my GOD, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee.

Then, with my waking Thoughts
Bright with Thy praise, Out of my stony griefs
Beth-el I’ll raise; So by my woes to be
Nearer, my GOD, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee.
