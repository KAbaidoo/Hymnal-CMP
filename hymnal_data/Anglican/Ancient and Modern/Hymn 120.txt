HYMN 120

O perfect life of love!
All, all is finished now;
All that He left His Throne above To do for us below.

No work is left undone
Of all the FATHER willed;
His toil, His sorrows, one by one, The scriptures have fulfilled.

No pain that we can share
But He has felt its smart;
All forms of human grief and care Have pierced that tender Heart.

And on His thorn-crowned heart, And on His sinless soul,
Our sins in all their guilt were laid, That He might make us whole.

In perfect love He dies;
For me He dies, for me;
O all-atoning sacrifice,
I cling by faith to Thee.

In every time of need,
Before the judgment-Throne, I plead,
Thy work, O Lamb of GOD, I'll
Thy merits, not my own.

Yet work, O LORD, in me
As Thou for me has wrought;
And let my love the answer be
To grace Thy love has brought.
