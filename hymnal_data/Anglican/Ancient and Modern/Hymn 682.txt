HYMN 682

Awake, our souls! away, our fears!
Let every trembling thought be gone!
And put a cheerful courage on.

True, 'tis a strait and thorny road,
And mortal spirits tire and faint:
But they forget the mighty God
That feeds the strength of every saint.

The mighty God, whose matchless power
Is ever new and ever young,
And firm endures, while endless years
Their everlasting circles run.

From Thee, the ever-flowing spring,
Our souls shall drink a fresh supply;
While such as trust their native strength
Shall melt away, and droop, and die.

Swift as an eagle cuts the air,
We'll mount aloft to thine abode;
On wings of love our souls shall fly,
Nor tire along the heavenly road.
