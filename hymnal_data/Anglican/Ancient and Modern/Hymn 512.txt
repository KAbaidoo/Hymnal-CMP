HYMN 512

O GOD of Jacob, by Whose hand
Thy people still are fed,
Who through this weary pilgrimage Hast all our FATHERs led;

Our vows, our prayers, we now
present
Before Thy Throne of grace;
GOD of our FATHERs, be the GOD
Of their succeeding race.

Through each perplexing path of life Our wandering footsteps guide;
Give us each day our daily bread, And raiment fit provide.

O spread Thy covering wings around, Till all our wanderings cease,
And at our FATHER’s loved abode
Our souls arrive in peace.
