HYMN 776

Thou didst leave Thy Throne and Thy kingly Crown, 
When Thou camest to earth for me; 
But in Bethlehem’s home was there 
For Thy holy Nativity; 
O come to my heart, LORD JESUS; There is room in my heart for Thee.

Heaven’s arches rang when the Angels sang, 
Proclaiming Thy royal decree; 
But in lowly birth didst Thou come 
And in great humility; 
O come to my heart, LORD JESUS; There is room in my heart for Thee.

The foxes found rest, and the bird had its nest 
In the shade of the cedar tree: 
But Thy couch was the sod, O Thou SON of GOD, 
In the desert of Galilee: 
O come to my heart, LORD, with the living word 
That should set Thy people free; But with mocking scorn and with crown of thorn 
They bore Thee to Calvary: 
O come to my heart, LORD JESUS; There is room in my heart for Thee.

When the heavens shall ring, and the Angels sing, 
At Thy coming to victory, 
Let Thy voice call me home, saying, “Yet there is room, 
There is room at my side for Thee:” 
O come to my heart, LORD JESUS; There is room in my heart for Thee.
