HYMN 745

Lift high the cross, the love of
Christ proclaim,
Till all the world adore His sacred name.

Come, brethren, follow where our
Captain trod,
Our King victorious, Christ the Son of God.
Lift high the cross, etc.

Led on their way by this triumphant
sign,
The hosts of God in conquering
ranks combine.
Lift high the cross, etc.

Each new-born soldier of the Crucified
Bears on his brow the seal of Him
who died.
Lift high the cross, etc.

This is the sign which Satan’s legions
fear,
The mystery which angel hosts revere.
Lift high the cross whereon their
Lord was slain,
The sons of Adam their lost home
regain.
Lift high the cross, etc.

O Lord, once lifted on the glorious
tree,
As Thou hast promised, draw men
unto Thee.
Lift high the cross, etc.

Let every race and every language tell
Of Him who saves our souls from
death and hell.
Lift high the cross, etc.

From farthest regions let them
homage bring,
And on His cross adore their Saviour King.
Lift high the cross, etc.

Set up Thy throne, that earth’s
despair may cease,
Beneath the shadow of its healing peace.
Lift high the cross, etc.

So shall our song of triumph ever be,
Praise to the Crucified for victory.
Lift high the cross, etc.
