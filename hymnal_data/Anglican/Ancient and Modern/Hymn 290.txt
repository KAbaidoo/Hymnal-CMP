HYMN 290

Through all the changing scenes
In trouble and in joy,
The praises of my GOD shall still
My heart and tongue employ.

O magnify the LORD with me,
With me exalt His Name;
When in distress to Him I called, He to my rescue came.

The Hosts of GOD encamp around
The dwellings of the just;
Deliverance He affords to all
Who on His succor trust.

O make but trial of His love,
Experience will decide
How blessed are they, and only they, Who in His truth confide.

Fear Him, ye saints, and you will
Have nothing else to fear;
Make you His service
your delight, Your wants shall be His care.

To FATHER, SON, and HOLY GHOST,
The GOD whom we adore,
Be glory, as it was, is now,
And shall be evermore.
