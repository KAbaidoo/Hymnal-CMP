HYMN 689

Once to every man and nation
comes the moment to decide,
In the strife of truth with falsehood, for the good or evil side;
Some great cause, like CHRIST in
Jewry offering each the bloom or blight,
Parts the goats upon the left hand
and the sheep upon the right,
And the choice goes by forever
'twixt that darkness and that light.

We see dimly in the present what is
small and what is great.
Slow of faith, how weak an arm may
turn the iron helm of fate: But the soul is still prophetic; list
amid the market’s din To the ominous stern whisper of the
oracle within, “They enslave their children’s
children who make compromise with sin.”
