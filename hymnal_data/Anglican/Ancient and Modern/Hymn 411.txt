HYMN 411 The Apostles

There is one Way, and only one,
Out of our gloom, and sin, and care, To that far land where shines no sun Because the Face of GOD is there.

There is one Truth, the truth of GOD, That CHRIST came down from Heav’n to show.
One life that His redeeming Blood
Has won for all His saints below.

The lore from Philip once concealed
We know its fullness now in CHRIST;
In Him the FATHER is revealed,
And all our longing is sufficed.

And still unwavering faith holds sure The words that James wrote sternly down;
Except we labor and endure,
We cannot win the heavenly crown

O way divine, through gloom and strife,
Bring us Thy FATHER’s face to see;
O heavenly truth, O precious Life,
At last, at last, we rest in Thee.

St. Barnabas the Apostle
