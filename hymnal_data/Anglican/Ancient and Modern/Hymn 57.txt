HYMN 57

O CHRIST, Redeemer of our race,
Thou Brightness of the FATHER’s Face,
Of Him, and with Him ever One,
Ere times and seasons had begun;

Thou that art very Light of Light,
Unfailing Hope in sin’s dark night,
Hear Thou the prayers Thy people pray,
The wide world o’er, this blessed day.

Remember, LORD of life and grace,
How once, to save a ruined race,
Thou didst our very flesh assume
In Mary’s undefiled womb.

To-day, as year by year its light
Sheds o’er the world a radiance bright,
One precious truth is echoed on,
‘’Tis Thou hast saved us, Thou alone.”
Thou from the FATHER’s Throne didst come

To call His banished children home;
And Heav’n, and earth, and sea,
and shore His love who sent Thee here adore.

And gladsome too are we to-day,
Whose guilt Thy blood has washed
Away; [sing Redeemed the new-made Song we
It is the birthday of our King.

O LORD, the virgin-born, to Thee
Eternal praise and glory be,
Whom with the FATHER we adore
And HOLY GHOST for evermore.
