HYMN 3

AWAKE, my soul, and with the sun
Thy daily stage of duty run;
Shake off dull sloth, and joyful rise
To pay Thy morning sacrifice.

Redeem Thy misspent time that’s past
And live this day as if Thy last;
Improve Thy talent with due care;
For the great day Thyself prepare.

Let all Thy converse be sincere,
Thy conscience as the noonday clear;
Think how all-seeing GOD Thy ways
And all Thy secret thought surveys.

Wake, and lift up Thyself, my heart,
And with the Angels bear Thy part,
Who all night long unwearied sing
High praise to the Eternal King.

Part 2

Glory to Thee Who safe hast kept,
And hast refreshed me whilst I slept;
Grant, LORD, when I from death shall wake
I may of endless light partake.

LORD, I my vows to Thee renew,
Scatter my sins, as morning dew;
Guard my first springs of thought and will,
And with Thyself my spirit fill.

Direct, control, suggest, this day,
All I design, or do, or say;
That all my powers, with all their might,
In Thy sole glory may unite.

The following Doxology should be sung at the end of either Part.

Praise GOD, from Whom all blessings flow,
Praise Him, all creatures here below
Praise Him above, Angelic host
Praise FATHER, SON, and HOLY GHOST.
