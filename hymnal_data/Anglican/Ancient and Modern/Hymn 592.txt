HYMN 592 For those at Sea

O LORD, be with us when we sail
Upon the lonely deep,
Our guard when on the silent deck The midnight watch we keep.

We need not fear, Though all around 'Mid rising winds we hear
The multitude of waters surge,
For Thou, O GOD, art near.

The calm, the breeze, the gale, the storm, That pass from land to land,
All, all are thine,
are held within The hollow of Thy hand.

If duty calls from threaten’d strife To guard our native shore,
And shot and shell are answering
The booming cannon’s roar,

Be Thou the main guard of our host, Till war and danger cease:
Defend the right, put up the sword, And through the world make peace.

To Thee the FATHER, Thee the SON, Whom earth and sky adore,
And SPIRIT, moving o’er the deep, Be praise for evermore.
