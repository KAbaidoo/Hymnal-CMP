HYMN 448

For Thy dear saint, O LORD,
Who strove in Thee to live,
Who followed Thee, obeyed, adored
Our grateful hymn receive.

For Thy dear saint, O LORD,
Who strove in Thee to die,
And found in Thee a full reward,
Accept our thankful cry.

Thine earthly members fit
To join Thy saints above,
In one communion ever knit,
One fellowship of love.

JESU, Thy Name we bless,
And humbly pray that we
May follow them in holiness
Who lived and died in Thee.

All might, all praise, be thine, FATHER, co-equal SON,
And SPIRIT, Bond of love Divine, While endless ages run.
