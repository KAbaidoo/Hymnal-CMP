HYMN 172

Praise to the Holiest in the height, And in the depth be praise;
In all His words most wonderful,
Most sure in all His ways.

O loving wisdom of our GOD!
When all was sin and shame,
A second Adam to the fight
And to the rescue came.

O wisest love! that flesh and blood, Which did in Adam fall
Should strive afresh against the foe, Should strive and should prevail;
And that a higher gift than grace Should flesh and blood refine,
GOD’s Presence and His very Self, And Essence all-divine.

O generous love! that He, who
In Man for man the foe, smote The double agony in man
For man should undergo;

And in the garden secretly,
And on the cross on high,
Should teach His brethren, and
To suffer and to die, inspire
Praise to the Holiest in the height, And in the depth be praise;
In all His words most wonderful,
Most sure in all His ways.
