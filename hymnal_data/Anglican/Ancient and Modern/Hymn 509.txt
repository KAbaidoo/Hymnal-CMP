HYMN 509 Trinity Sunday

Be near us, Holy Trinity,
One Light, one only Deity!
All things are thine, on Thee depend, Who art Beginning without end.

The myriad armies of the sky
Praise, bless, adore Thy Majesty:
Earth’s triple frame - land, air, and sea -
Upraise their canticle to Thee.

We too, Thy suppliant servants all,
Before Thy feet adoring fall:
To Thee our vows and prayers we bring,
With hymns that Saints and Angels sing.

One we believe Thee, Light Divine,
And worship in a glorious Trine:
O First and Last, we humbly cry,
And all things having breath reply.

Praise to the FATHER, made of none,
Praise to His sole-begotten SON,
Praise to the Holy SPIRIT be, -
Mysterious GODhead, One in Three!
