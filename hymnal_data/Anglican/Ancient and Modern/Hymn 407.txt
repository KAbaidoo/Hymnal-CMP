HYMN 407

O Zion, open wide Thy gates,
Let figures disappear;
A Priest and Victim both in one, The Truth Himself, is here.

No more the simple flock shall bleed; Behold, the Father's Son
Himself to His own Altar comes,
For sinners to atone.

Conscious of hidden Deity,
The lowly Virgin brings doves,
Her new-born Babe, with two young offerings.

The aged Simeon sees at last
His Lord so long desired,
And Anna welcomes Israel's Hope
With holy rapture fired.

But silent knelt the Mother blest of the yet silent Word,
And, pondering all things in her heart,
With speechless praise adored.

All glory to the Father be,
All glory to the Son,
All glory, Holy Ghost, to Thee, While endless ages run.

St. Matthias the Apostle
