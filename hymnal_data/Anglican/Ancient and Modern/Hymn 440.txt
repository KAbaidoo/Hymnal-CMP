HYMN 440

Blessed feasts of blessed Martyrs, Holydays of holy men,
With affection’s recollections
Greet we your return again.

Worthy deeds they wrought and
wonders,
Worthy of the Name they bore;
We with meetest praise and sweetest
Honour them for evermore.

Faith prevailing, hope unfailing, JESUS loved with single heart—
Thus they glorious and victorious Bravely bore the Martyr’s part.

Racked with torture, haled to
slaughter,
Fire, and axes, and murderous sword, Chains and prison, foes’ derision They endured
for CHRIST the LORD.

So they passed through pain and sorrow,
Til they sank in death to rest; Earth’s rejected, GOD’s elected, Gained a portion with the
blest.

By contempt of worldly pleasures, And by deeds of valour done,
They have reached the land of Angels, And with them are knit in one.

Made co-heirs with CHRIST in glory, His celestial …………. they share; May they now
before Him bending, Help us onward by their prayer;
That, this weary life completed, And its fleeting trials past,
We may win eternal glory
In our FATHER’s home at last.
