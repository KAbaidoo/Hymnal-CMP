HYMN 442

O GOD, Thy soldiers’ great reward,
Their portion, crown, and faithful
LORD,
From all transgressions set us free
Who sing Thy Martyr’s victory.

By wisdom taught he learns to
The vanity of all below,
The fleeting joys of earth disdained,
And everlasting glory gained.

Right manfully his cross he bore,
And ran his race of torments sore;
For Thee he poured his life away,
With Thee he lives in endless day.

We therefore pray Thee, LORD of
Love,
Regard us from Thy Throne above;
On this Thy Martyr’s triumph-day
Wash every stain of sin away.

All praise to GOD the FATHER be,
All praise, eternal SON to Thee,
Whom with the SPIRIT we adore
Forever and forevermore.
