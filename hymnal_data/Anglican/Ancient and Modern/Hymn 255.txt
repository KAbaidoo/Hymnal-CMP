HYMN 255

Just as I am, without one plea
But that Thy blood was shed for me,
And that Thou bidd’st me come to
Thee,
O Lamb of GOD, I come.

Just as I am, Though toss’d about
With many a conflict, many a doubt,
Fightings and fears within, without,
O Lamb of GOD, I come.

Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;
Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
Yea all I need, in Thee to find,
O Lamb of GOD, I come.

Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve; Because Thy promise I believe,
O Lamb of GOD, I come.

Just as I am, (Thy love unknown
Has broken every barrier down),
Now to be thine, yea, thine alone,
O Lamb of GOD, I come.

Just as I am, of that free love
The breadth, length, depth, and
Height to prove,
Here for a season, then above,
O Lamb of GOD, I come.
