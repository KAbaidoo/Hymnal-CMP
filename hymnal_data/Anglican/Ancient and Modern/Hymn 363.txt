HYMN 363

Almighty GOD, whose only SON
O’er sin and death the triumph won,
And ever lives to intercede
For souls who Thy sweet mercy need;

In His dear Name to Thee we pray
For all who err and go astray,
For sinners, whereso’er they be,
Who do not serve and honour Thee,

There are who never yet have heard
The tidings of Thy blessed word,
But still in heathen darkness dwell, Without one thought of Heav’n or hell;

And some within Thy sacred fold
To holy things are dead and cold,
And waste the precious hours of life
In selfish ease, or toil, or strife;
And many a quickened soul within
There lurks the secret love of sin,
A wayward will, or anxious fears,
Or lingering taint of bygone years.

O give repentance true and deep
To all Thy lost and wandering sheep, And kindle in their hearts the fire
Of holy love and pure desire.

That so from Angel-hosts above
May rise a sweeter song of love,
And we, with all the blest, adore
Thy Name, O GOD, for evermore.
