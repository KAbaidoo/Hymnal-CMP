HYMN 621 of Evangelists

Come sing, ye choirs exultant,
Those messengers of GOD,
Through whom the living Gospels came sounding abroad!
Whose voice proclaims salvation, That poured upon the night,
And drove away the shadows,
And flushed the world with light,

He chose them, our Good Shepherd, And, tending evermore quarters, His flock through Earth’s four
In wisdom made them four;
True Lawgiver, He bade them
Their healing message speed,-
One charter for all nations.
One glorious title-deed!

In one harmonious witness
The chose four combine,
While each his own commission
Fulfils in every line;
As in the Prophet’s vision,
From out the amber flame
In form of visage diverse
Four Living creatures came.

Lo, these the winged chariots,
That bring Emmanuel nigh,
The golden staves, uplifting
GOD’s very Ark on high;
And these the fourfold river
Of Paradise above,
Whence flow for all the nations New mysteries of love.

Four-square on this foundation
The Church of CHRIST remains,
A House to stand unshaken
By floods or winds or rains.
Oh! glorious happy portion
In this safe Home to be,
By GOD, true Man, united
With GOD eternally!
