HYMN 618 All Saints’ Day

Bride of CHRIST, whose glorious
warfare
Here on earth hath never rest
Lift Thy voice, and tell the triumphs Of the holy and the blest
Joyous be the day we hallow,
Feast of all the Saints on high, Earth and Heav’n together blending In one solemn
harmony.

First the blessed Virgin mother, Reunited to her SON,
Leads the host of ransom’d people, Who unfading crowns have won;
John the herald, CHRIST’s forerunner, More than Prophet, heads his throng, Seer and
Patriarch responsive
Unto Psalmist in their Song.

Lo, the Twelve, majestic Princes, In the court of JESUS sit,
Calmly watching, while the conflict rages far beneath their feet:
Lo, the Martyrs, robed in crimson, Sing of life-blood freely spent, Finding life, because
they lost it, Dwell in undisturbed content.

All the saintly host who witnessed Good confessions for His sake—
Priest and Deacon, world-renouncing, Of their Master’s joy partake;
Virgins to the Lamb devoted,
Following with steadfast love,
Bring their lilies and their roses To the Marriage Feast above.

All, their happy lot fulfilling, GOD Omnipotent proclaim;
Holy, Holy, Holy, crying,
Glory to His Holy Name!
So may GOD in mercy grant us
Here to serve in holiness,
Til He call us to the portion
Which His saints in light possess.
