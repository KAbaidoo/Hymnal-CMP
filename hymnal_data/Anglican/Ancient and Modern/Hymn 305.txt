HYMN 305

SAVIOUR, blessed SAVIOUR,
Listen whilst we sing,
Hearts and voices raising
Praise to our King:
All we have to offer;
All we hope to be,
Body, soul, and SPIRIT,
All we yield to Thee.

Nearer, ever nearer,
CHRIST, we draw to Thee,
Deep in adoration,
Bending low the knee;
Thou for our redemption
Cam’st to earth to die;
Thou, that we might follow, Hast gone upon high.

Great and ever greater
Are Thy mercies here;
True and everlasting
Are the glories there;
Where no pain, nor sorrow,
Toil, nor care, is known,
Where the angel legions
Circle round Thy Throne.

Dark and ever darker
Was the wintry past,
Now a ray of gladness
O’er our path is cast;
Every day that passes,
Every hour that flies,
Tells of love unfeigned,
Love that never dies.

Clearer still and clearer
Dawns the light from Heav’n,
In our sadness bringing
News of sin forgiven;
Life has lost its shadows, Pure the light within;
Thou hast shed Thy radiance On a world of sin.

Brighter still and brighter
Glow the western sun,
Shedding all its gladness
O’er our work that’s done;
Time will soon be over,
Toil and sorrow past,
May we, blessed SAVIOUR,
Find a rest at last.

Onward, ever onward
Journeying o’er the road
Worn by Saints before us,
Journeying unto GOD;
Leaving all behind us,
May we hasten on,
Backward never looking
Till the prize is won.

Bliss, all bliss excelling, When the ransomed soul,
Earthly toils forgetting,
Finds its promised goal;
Where in joys unheard of
Saints with Angels sing,
Never weary raising
Praise to their King.
