HYMN 9 
The Third Hour

Come, HOLY GHOST, Whoever One
Art with the FATHER and the SON, 
Come, HOLY GHOST, our souls possess 
With Thy full flood of holiness.

In will and deed, by heart and tongue, 
With all our powers, Thy praise be sung; 
And love light up our mortal frame, 
Till others catch the living flame.

Almighty FATHER, hear our cry 
Through JESUS CHRIST our LORD most high, 
Who with the HOLY GHOST and Thee 
Doth live and reign eternally
