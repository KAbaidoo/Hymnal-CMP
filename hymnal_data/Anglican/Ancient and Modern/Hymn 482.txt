HYMN 482 CHRISTmas

Angels, from the realms of glory,
Wing your flight o’er all the earth; Ye who sang creation’s story,
Now proclaim Messiah’s birth;
Come and worship,

Worship CHRIST, the new-born King,
Shepherds, in the field abiding,
Watching o’er your flocks by night, GOD with man is now residing,
Yonder shines the infant’s light;
Come and worship,
Worship CHRIST, the new-born King.

Sages, leave your contemplations,
Brighter visions beam afar;
Seek the great desire of nations,
You have seen His natal star;
Come and worship,
Worship CHRIST, the new-born King.

All creation, join in praising
GOD the FATHER, SPIRIT, SON—
Evermore your voices raising
To th’ Eternal THREE in ONE;
Come and worship,
Worship CHRIST, the new-born King.
