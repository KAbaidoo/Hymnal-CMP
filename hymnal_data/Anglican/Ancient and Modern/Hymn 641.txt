HYMN 641

“Behold the Bridegroom draweth 
nigh:’
Hear ye the oft-repeated cry?
Go forth into the midnight dim;
For bless’d are they whom He shall
find
With red heart and watchful mind;
Go forth, my soul, to Him.

“Behold the bridegroom cometh
The call is echoed from the sky:
Go forth, ye servants, watch and
wait;
The slothful cannot join His train; No careless one may entrance gain;
Awake, my soul, ‘tis late.

The wise will plead with one accord, “O Holy, Holy, Holy, LORD,
On us Thy quick’ning grace bestow,
That none may reach the door too
late,
When Thou shalt enter at the gate
And to Thy kingdom go.”

“Behold the Bridegroom draweth
near,”
The warning falls on every ear:

That night of dread shall come to all; Behold, my soul, Thy lamp so dim,
Rise, the smoking flax to trim;
Soon shalt Thou hear His call.
