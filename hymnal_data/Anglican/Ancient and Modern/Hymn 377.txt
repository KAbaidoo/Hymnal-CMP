HYMN 377 PESTILENCE

In grief and fear to Thee, O LORD, We now for succor fly;
Thine awful judgments are abroad, O shield us lest we die.

The fell disease on every side Walks forth with tainted breath; And pestilence, with rapid
stride, Bestrews the land with death.

O look with pity on the scene
Of sadness and of dread;
And let thine Angel stand between The living and the dead.

With contrite hearts to Thee, our King
We turn who oft have strayed;
Accept the sacrifice we bring, And let the plague be stayed.
