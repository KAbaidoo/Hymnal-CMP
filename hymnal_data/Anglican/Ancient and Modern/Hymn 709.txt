HYMN 709

Praise to our GOD, whose bounteous
hand
Prepared of old our glorious land;
A garden fenced with silver sea;
A people prosperous, strong, and
free.

Praise to our GOD; through all our
past
His mighty arm hath held us fast;
Till wars and perils, toils and tears, Have brought the rich and peaceful
years.

Praise to our GOD; the vine He set
Within our coasts is fruitful yet;
On many a shore her offshoots grow; 'Neath many a sun her clusters glow.

Praise to our GOD; His power alone
Can keep unmoved our ancient
Throne,
Sustained by counsels wise and just, And guarded by a people’s trust,

Praise to our GOD; who still forbears,
Who still this sinful nation spares, Who calls us still to seek His face, And lengthens out
our day of grace.

Praise to our GOD; Though
chastenings stern
Our evil dross should thoroughly burn, His rod and staff, from age to age, Shall rule and
guide His heritage!
