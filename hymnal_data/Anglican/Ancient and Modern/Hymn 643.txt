HYMN 643 Epiphany

Brightest and best of the Sons of
the morning,
Dawn on our darkness, and lend us
thine aid!
Star of the East, the horizon adorning
Guide where our infant redeemer is
laid!

Cold on His cradle the dew-drops are
shining;
Low lies His head with the beasts
of the stall;
Angels adore Him in slumber reclining,
Maker and Monarch and SAVIOUR of
all.
Say, shall we yield Him, in costly
devotion,
Odours of Edom, and offerings divine
Gems of the mountain, and pearls
of the ocean,
Myrrh from the forest, or gold from
the mine?

Vainly we offer each ample oblation,
Vainly with gifts would His favour
secure;
Richer by far is the heart’s adoration,
Dearer to GOD are the prayers of
the poor.
The first verse may be repeated at the
end.
