HYMN 622 Virgin Mary

Virgin-Born, we bow before Thee;
Blessed was the womb that bore Thee; Mary, Maid and Mother mild,
Blessed was she in her Child.

Blessed was the breast that fed Thee; Blessed was the hand that led Thee; Blessed was
the parent’s eye
That watched Thy slumbering infancy.
Blessed she by all creation,
Who brought forth the world’s Salvation,
And blessed they - forever blessed,
Who love Thee most and serve Thee best.
Virgin-Born, we bow before Thee;
Blessed was the womb that bore Thee; Mary, Maid and Mother mild,
Blessed was she in her Child.
