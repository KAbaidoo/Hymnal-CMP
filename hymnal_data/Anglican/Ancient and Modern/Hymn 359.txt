HYMN 359

SAVIOUR, sprinkle many nations,
Fruitful let Thy sorrows be
By Thy pains and consolations
Draw the Gentiles unto Thee:
Of Thy Cross the wondrous story,
Be it to the nations told;
Let them see Thee in Thy glory,
And Thy mercy manifold.

Far and wide, Though all unknowing, Pants for Thee each mortal breast; Human tears for
Thee are flowing, Human hearts in Thee would rest;
Thirsting, as for dews of even, As the new-mown grass for rain,
Thee they seek, as GOD of Heaven, Thee, as Man, for sinner slain.

SAVIOUR, lo! the isles are waiting, Stretch’d the hand, and strain’d the sight,
For Thy SPIRIT new creating,
Love’s pure flame and wisdom’s light; Give the word, and of the preacher Speed the foot,
and touch the tongue, Till on earth by every creature
Glory to the Lamb be sung.
