HYMN 106

My GOD, I love Thee, not because
I hope for heaven thereby,
Nor yet because who love
Thee not Are lost eternally,

Thou, O my JESUS, Thou didst me
Upon the Cross embrace;
For me didst bear the nails,
and spear, And manifold disgrace.

And griefs and torments numberless,
And sweat of agony;
Yea, death itself; and all for me
Who was Thine enemy

Then why O Blessed JESU CHRIST,
Should I not love Thee well?
Not for the sake of winning heaven,
Nor of escaping hell;

Not from the hope of gaining aught,
Nor seeking a reward;
But as Thyself hast loved me
O ever-loving LORD.

So would I love Thee, dearest LORD,
And in Thy praise will sing;
Solely because Thou art my GOD,
And my most loving King.
