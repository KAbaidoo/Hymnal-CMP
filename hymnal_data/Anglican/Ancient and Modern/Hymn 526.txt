HYMN 526

Lo! GOD is here! Let us adore, And own how dreadful is this place!
Let all within us feel His power, And silent bow before His face; Who know His power,
His grace who prove,
Serve Him with awe, with reverence love.

Lo! GOD is here! Him day and night The united choirs of Angels sing; To Him,
Enthroned above all height, The hosts of Heav’n their praises bring;
Disdain not, LORD our meaner Song, Who praise Thee with a faltering tongue.

Being of beings! may our praise Thy courts with grateful fragrance fill;
Still may we stand before Thy face, Still hear and do Thy sovereign will; To Thee may all
our Thoughts arise A true and ceaseless sacrifice.
