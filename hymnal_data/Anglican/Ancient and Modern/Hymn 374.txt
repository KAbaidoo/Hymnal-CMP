HYMN 374

GOD of our life, to Thee we call
Afflicted at Thy feet we fall;
When the great water-floods prevail,
Leave not our trembling hearts to fail.

Friend of the friendless and the faint, Where should we lodge our deep
complaint? Where but with Thee, whose open door
Invites the helpless and the poor?

Did ever mourner plead with Thee,
And Thou refuse that mourner’s plea?
Does not the Word still fix’d remain,
That none shall seek Thy face in vain?

Then hear, O LORD, our humble cry,
And bend on us Thy pitying eye;
To Thee their prayer Thy people make,
Hear us for our redeemer’s sake.
