HYMN 207

Our Blest Redeemer, ere He breathed His tender last farewell, A Guide, a Comforter, 
bequeathed With us to dwell. 

He came sweet influence to impart, A gracious willing Guest, While He can find one 
humble heart Wherein to rest. 

And His that gentle voice we hear, Soft as the breath of even, That checks each fault, that 
calms each fear, 
And speaks of Heav’n. 

And every virtue we possess, And every conquest won, 
And every thought of holiness, Are His alone. 

SPIRIT of purity and grace, Our weakness, pitying, see: O make our hearts Thy dwelling 
place, And worthier Thee.
