HYMN 617

FATHER, before Thy Throne of light The guardian Angels bend,
And ever In Thy Presence bright
Their psalms adoring blend;

And casting down each golden crown,
Beside the crystal sea, With voice and lyre, in happy quire, Hymn glory, LORD, to Thee.

And as the rainbow luster falls
Athwart their glowing wings,
While Seraph unto Seraph calls,
And each Thy goodness sings;
So may we feel, as low we kneel
To pray Thee for Thy grace,
That Thou art here for all who fear the brightness of Thy face

Here, where the Angels see us come To worship day by day,
Teach us to seek our Heavenly home, And love Thee e’en as they;
Teach us to raise our notes of praise, With them they love to own,
That childhood’s flower, and man—
hood’s power,
Be thine and thine alone.
