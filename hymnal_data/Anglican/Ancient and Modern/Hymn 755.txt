HYMN 755 Evangelists

How beauteous are their feet,
Who stand on Zion’s hill;
Who bring salvation on their tongues And words of peace instill!
How happy are our ears
That hear this joyful sound,
which kings and prophets waited for, And sought, but never found!

How blessed are our eyes
That see this heavenly light!
Prophets and kings desired it long, But died without the sight.

The LORD makes bare His arm
Through all the earth abroad;
Let every nation now behold
Their SAVIOR and their GOD.
