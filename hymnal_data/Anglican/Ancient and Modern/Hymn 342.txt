HYMN 342

Gracious SAVIOR, gentle Shepherd, Little ones are dear to Thee;
Gathered with thine arms, and carried In Thy bosom may we be;
Sweetly, fondly, safely tended,
From all want and danger free.

Tender Shepherd, never leave us
From Thy fold to go astray;
By Thy look of love directed
May we walk the narrow way;
Thus direct us, and protect us,
Lest we fall an easy prey.

Cleanse our hearts from sinful folly In the stream Thy love supplied,
Mingled stream of blood and water, Flowing from Thy wounded side;
And to heavenly pastures lead us,
Where thine own still waters glide.

Let Thy holy word instruct us;
Guide us daily by its light;
Let Thy love and grace constrain us To approve whate’er is right,
Take thine easy yoke, and wear it.
Strengthened with Thy heavenly might.

Taught to lisp the holy praises
Which on earth Thy children sing,
Both with lips and hearts unfeigned May we our thank-offerings bring;
Then with all the saints in glory
Join to praise our LORD and King.
