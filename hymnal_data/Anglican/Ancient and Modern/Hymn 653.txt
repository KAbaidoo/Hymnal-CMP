HYMN 653 Whitsuntide

Hail, festal day, of never-dying
fame,
when first upon the Church the
SPIRIT came.
The sun has now a higher track to
keep
Betwixt the eastern and the western
Hail, festal day, &c.

Through clearer air it shoots more
searching rays,
And makes short night between the
lengthening days.
Hail, festal day, &c.

Far depths of cloudless sky are
bared to sight;
The clear stars tell their story of
delight,
Hail, festal day, &c.

The merry countryside offers all her store,
Now spring has brought its yearly
wealth once more.
Hail, festal day, &c.

White gleam the hawthorn bushes as
we pass,
And green and tall grows up the
waving grass.
Hail, festal day, &c.

Day after day fresh flowers like stars
arise,
And all the turf breaks into laughing
Hail, festal day, &c.
