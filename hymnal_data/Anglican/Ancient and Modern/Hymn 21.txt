HYMN 21

The day is past and over;
All thanks, O LORD, to Thee
I pray Thee now that sinless
The hours of dark may be:
O JESU, keep me in Thy sight,
And guard me through the coming
night.

The joys of day are over;
I lift my heart to Thee,
And ask Thee that offenseless
The hours of dark may be:
O JESU, keep me in Thy sight,
And guard me through the coming
night.

The toils of day are over,
I raise the hymn to Thee,
And ask that free from peril
The hours of dark may be:
O JESU, keep me in Thy sight,
And guard me through the coming
night.

Be Thou my soul’s preserver,
For Thou alone dost know
How many are the perils
Through which I have to go:
O loving JESU, hear my call,
And guard and save me from them all.
