HYMN 337

There’s a Friend for little children Above the bright blue sky,
A Friend who never changes,
Whose love will never die;
Our earthly friends may fail us, And change with changing years, This friend is always worthy
Of that dear Name He bears.

There’s a rest for little children Above the bright blue sky
Who love the Blessed SAVIOR,
And to the FATHER cry;
A rest from every turmoil
From sin and sorrow free,
where every little pilgrim
Shall rest eternally.

There’s a home for little children Above the bright blue sky,
Where JESUS reigns in glory,
A home of peace and joy;
No home on earth is like it,
Nor can with it compare;
For everyone is happy,
Nor could be happier, there.

There’s a crown for little children Above the bright blue sky,
And all who look for JESUS
Shall wear it by and by;
A crown of brightest glory,
Which He will then bestow
On those who found His favor
And loved His name below.

There’s a Song for little children Above the bright blue sky,
A Song that will not weary,
Thou sung continually;
A Song which even Angels
Can never, never sing;
They know no CHRIST as SAVIOR, But worship Him as King.

There’s a robe for little children Above the bright blue sky;
And a harp of sweetest music,
And palms of victory,
All, all above is treasured,
And found in CHRIST alone;
LORD, grant Thy little children To know Thee as their own.
