HYMN 759 of our LORD

‘Tis good, LORD, to be here!
Thy glory fills the night;
Thy face and garments, like the sun, Shine with unborrowed light.

‘Tis good, LORD, to be here,-
Thy beauty to behold
Where Moses and Elijah stand,
Thy messengers of old.

Fulfiller of the past!
Promise of things to be!
We hail Thy Body glorified,
And our redemption see.

Before we taste of death,
We see Thy kingdom come;
We fain would hold the vision bright, And make this hill our home.

‘Tis we may not remain: [mount But since Thou bidst us leave the Come with us to the plain.
