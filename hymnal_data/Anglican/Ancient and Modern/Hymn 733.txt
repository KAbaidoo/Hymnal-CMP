HYMN 733 Confirmation

AFTER THE CONFIRMATION
Once pledged by the cross
As children of GOD,
To tread in the steps
Your Captain has trod,
Now, sealed by the SPIRIT
Of Wisdom and Might,
Go forward, CHRIST’s soldiers, Go forward and fight!

Your weapons of war
Are sent from above,
The SPIRIT’s good sword,
The breastplate of love;
Your feet with the Gospel
Of peace be well shod;
Put on the whole armor,
The armor of GOD.

Full well do you know
The foe must be met,
Full well do you feel
That Satan has set
His powers of Darkness
In battle array;
But those who are for you
Are stronger than they.

The fight may be long,
But triumph is sure,
And rest comes at last
To those who endure;
The rest that remaineth,
The victory won,
and – dearer than all things - Your Captain’s “Well done.”

Then, on to the fight
‘Gainst sin and the world,
Stand fast in His strength, His banner unfurled;
And, sealed by the SPIRIT
Of Wisdom and Might,
Go forward, CHRIST’s soldiers, Go forward and fight.
