HYMN 510 General Hymns

Hail, FATHER, Whose creating call Unnumbered worlds attend;
Who art in all and over all,
Thyself both source and end:

In light unsearchable enthroned,
Whom Angels dimly see,
The Fountain of the GODhead owned First-named among the Three.

From Thee, through an eternal now, Springs Thy co-equal SON;
An everlasting FATHER Thou,
Ere time began to run.

Not quite displayed to worlds above, Nor quite on earth concealed,
By wondrous, unexhausted love
To mortal man revealed.

When Nature’s outworn robe shall be Exchanged for new attire;
And earth, which rose at Thy decree, Dissolve before Thy fire;

Thy Name, O GOD, be still adored
Through ages without end,
Whom none but thine essential
And SPIRIT comprehend.
