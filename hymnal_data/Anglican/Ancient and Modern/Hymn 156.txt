HYMN 156

Come, Thou Holy SPIRIT, come;
And from Thy celestial home
Shed a ray of light Divine;
Come, Thou FATHER of the poor,
Come, Thou source of all our store, Come, within our bosoms shine:

Thou of Comforters the best,
Thou the soul’s most welcome guest, Sweet refreshment here below;
In our labor rest most sweet,
Grateful coolness in the heat,
Solace in the midst of woe.

O most Blessed Light Divine,
Shine within these hearts of Thine, And our inmost being fill;
Where Thou art not, man hath nought,
Nothing good in deed or thought,
Nothing free from taint of ill.

Heal our wounds: our strength renew; On our dryness pour Thy dew;
Wash the stains of guilt away;
Bend the stubborn heart and will;
Melt the frozen, warm the chill;
Guide the steps that go astray.

On the faithful, who adore
And confess Thee, evermore
In Thy sevenfold gifts descend:
Give them virtues sure reward,
Give them Thy salvation LORD,
Give them joys that never end.
