HYMN 344 FOR A SCHOOL FEAST

LORD JESUS, GOD and Man,
For love of man a child,
The very GOD, yet born on earth Of Mercy undefiled;

LORD JESUS, GOD and Man,
In this our festal day
To Thee for precious gifts of grace Thy ransomed people pray

We pray for childlike hearts,
For gentle holy love,
For strength to do Thy will below As Angels do above.

We pray for simple faith,
For hope that never faints,
For true communion evermore
With all Thy blessed saints.

On friends around us here
O let Thy blessing fall;
We pray for grace to love them But Thee beyond them all.

O joy to live for Thee!
O joy in Thee to die!
O very joy of joys to see
Thy face eternally!

LORD JESUS, GOD and Man,
We praise Thee and adore,
Who art with GOD the FATHER One And SPIRIT evermore.
