HYMN 195

O Love Divine, how sweet Thou art!
When shall I find my willing heart All taken up by Thee?
I thirst, I faint, I die to prove
The greatness of redeeming love,
the love of CHRIST to me.

Stronger His love than death or hell; Its riches are unsearchable;
The first-born Sons of light
Desire in vain its depths to see;
They cannot reach the mystery,
The length, and breadth, and height.

GOD only knows the love of GOD;
O that it now were shed abroad
In this poor stony heart!
For love I sigh, for love I pine;
This only Portion, LORD, be mine,
Be mine this better part.

Forever would I take my seat
With Mary at the Master’s feet;
Be this my happy choice;
My only care, delight, and bliss,
My joy, my heaven on earth, be this, To hear the Bridegroom’s voice.
