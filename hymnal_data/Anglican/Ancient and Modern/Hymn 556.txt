HYMN 556

VICTIM Divine, Thy grace we claim
While thus Thy precious Death we show;
Once offered up, a spotless Lamb,
In Thy great temple here below,
Thou didst for all mankind atone,
And standest now before the Throne.

Thou standest in the holiest place,
As now for guilty sinners slain;
Thy Blood of sprinkling speaks and prays
All prevalent for helpless man;
Thy Blood is still our ransom found,
And spreads salvation all around.

GOD still respects Thy sacrifice,
Its savour sweet doth always please;
The Offering smokes through earth and skies,
Diffusing life and joy and peace;
To these Thy lower courts it comes,
And fills them with Divine perfumes.

We need not now go up to Heav’n
To bring the long-sought SAVIOUR down;
Thou art to all that seek Thee given, Thou dost e’en now Thy banquet crown:
To every faithful soul appear,
And show Thy Real Presence here.
