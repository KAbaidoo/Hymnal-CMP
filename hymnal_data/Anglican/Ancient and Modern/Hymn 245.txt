HYMN 245

When at Thy footstool, LORD I
bend,
And plead with Thee for mercy there,
Think of the sinner’s dying Friend,
And for His sake receive my prayer.

O think not of my shame and guilt,
My thousand stains of deepest dye;
Think of the Blood which JESUS spilt,
And let that Blood my pardon buy,
Think, LORD, how I am still thine own,
The trembling creature of Thy hand;
Think how my heart to sin is prone,
And what temptations round me stand.

O think upon Thy holy Word,
And every plighted promise there;
How prayer should ever more be heard,
And how Thy glory is to spare.

O think not of my doubts and fears,
My strivings with Thy grace Divine,
Think upon JESUS’ woes and tears,
And let His merits stand for mine.

Thine eye, Thine ear, they are not dull.
Thine arm can never shortened be,
Behold me here; my heart is full;
Behold, and spare, and succor me.
