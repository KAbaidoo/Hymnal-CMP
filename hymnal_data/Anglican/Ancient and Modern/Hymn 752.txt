HYMN 752 Michaelmas

O Captain of GOD’s host, whose
dreadful might Led forth to war the armed seraphim,
And from the starry height,
Subdued in burning fight,
Cast down that ancient dragon dark
and grim;

Thine angels, CHRIST, we laud in
solemn lays,
Our elder brethren of the crystal sky, Who ‘mid Thy glory’s blaze
The ceaseless anthem raise
And gird Thy Throne in faithful
ministry.

We celebrate their love, whose
viewless wing [high, Hath left for us so oft their mansion The mercies of their King
To mortal saints to bring, [infancy.
Or guard the couch of slumbering

But Thee, the First and Last, we
glorify,
Who, when Thy world was sunk in
death and sin, Not with thine own arm the
battle win;

Alone didst pass the dark and dismal
shore, [and alone, Alone didst tread the wine-press,
All glorious in Thy gore,
Didst light and life restore [done.
To us who lay in darkness and undone

Therefore with angels and archangels
we [raise, To Thy dear love our thankful chorus
And tune our songs to Thee
Who art, and art to be,
And, endless as Thy mercies, sound
Thy praise.
