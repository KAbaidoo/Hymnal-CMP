HYMN 508

Come, HOLY GHOST, eternal GOD,
Proceeding from above,
Both from the FATHER and the SON, The GOD of peace and love;

Visit our minds, into our hearts Thy heavenly grace inspire;
That truth and GODliness we may Pursue with full desire.

Thou in Thy gifts art manifold; By them CHRIST’s church doth stand;
In faithful hearts Thou writ’st Thy The Finger of GOD’s hand.

According to Thy promise, LORD, Thou givest speech with grace,
That through Thy help GOD’s
praises may
Resound in every place;
Kindle our hearts with fervent zeal To serve GOD day and night.

Our weakness strengthen and confirm, For, LORD, Thou know’st us frail; That neither devil, world, nor
flesh, Against us may prevail.

Put back our enemy from us,
And help us to obtain
Peace in our hearts with GOD and man,-
The best, the truest gain;

Of strife and of dissension
Dissolve, O LORD, the bands,
And knit the knots of peace and love Throughout all Christian lands.

Grant us the grace that we may know The FATHER of all might,
That we of His beloved SON
May gain the blissful sight;

And that we may with perfect faith Ever acknowledge Thee,
The SPIRIT of FATHER, and of SON, One GOD in PerSON Three.

To GOD the FATHER laud, and praise, And to His Blessed SON
And to the Holy SPIRIT of grace, Co-equal THREE in ONE.
