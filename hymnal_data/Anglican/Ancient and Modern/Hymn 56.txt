HYMN 56

Of the FATHER’s Love begotten
Ere the worlds began to be,
He is Alpha and Omega,
He the source, the ending He,
Of the things that are, that have been,
And that future years shall see,
Evermore and evermore.

At His word the worlds were framed;
He commanded; it was done;
Heav’n and earth and depth of ocean
In their threefold order one;
All that grows beneath the shining
Of the moon and burning sun,
Evermore and evermore.

He is found in human fashion,
Death and sorrow here to know,
That the race of Adam’s children,
Doomed by Law to endless woe,
May not henceforth die and perish
In the dreadful gulf below;
Evermore and evermore.

O that birth forever blessed!
When the Virgin, full of grace,
By the HOLY GHOST conceiving,
Bore the SAVIOUR of our race,
And the Babe, the world’s redeemer,
First revealed His sacred Face,
Evermore and evermore.

This is He whom seers in old time
Chanted of with one accord;
Whom the voices of the Prophets
Promised in their faithful word;
Now He shines, the long expected;
Let creation praise its LORD,
Evermore and evermore.

O ye heights of Heav’n, adore Him;
Angel-hosts, His praises sing;
All dominions, bow before Him,
And extol our GOD and King;
Let not one earth be silent,
Every voice in concert ring,
Evermore and evermore.

Righteous Judge of souls departed,
Righteous King of them that live,
On the FATHER’s Throne exalted
None in might with Them strive;
Who at last in vengeance coming
Sinners from Thy face shall drive
Evermore and evermore.

Then let old men, then let young,
Then let boys in chorus sing;
Matrons, virgins, little maidens,
With glad voices answering:
Let their guileless songs re-echo,
And the heart its praises bring,
Evermore and evermore.

CHRIST, to Thee, with GOD the FATHER,
And, O HOLY GHOST, to Thee,
Hymn, and chant, and high thanksgiving,
And unwearied praises be,
Honor, glory, and dominion,
And eternal victory,
Evermore and evermore.
