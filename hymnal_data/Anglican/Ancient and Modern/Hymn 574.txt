HYMN 574

Hushed was the evening hymn,
The temple courts were dark;
The lamp was burning dim
Before the sacred ark;
When suddenly a voice divine
Rang through the silence of the shrine.

The old man, meek and mild,
The priest of Israel, slept;
His watch the Temple child,
The little Levite kept;
And what from Eli’s sense was sealed, The LORD to Hannah’s SON revealed.

Oh! give me Samuel’s ear,
The open ear, O LORD,
Alive and quick to hear
Each whisper of Thy word;
Like him to answer at Thy call, And to obey Thee first of all.

Oh! give me Samuel’s heart,
A lowly heart, that waits
Wherein Thy house Thou art,
Or watches at Thy gates,
By day and night, a heart that still Moves at the breathing of Thy will.

Oh! give me Samuel’s mind,
A sweet unmurmuring faith,
Obedient and resigned
To Thee in life and death;
That I may read with child-like eyes Truths that are hidden from the wise.
