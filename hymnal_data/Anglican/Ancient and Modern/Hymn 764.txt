HYMN 764

Rescue the perishing,
Care for the dying,
Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;
Weep o’er the erring one,
Lift up the fallen, save,
Tell them of JESUS the might to
Rescue the perishing,
Care for the dying;
JESUS is merciful
JESUS will save

Though they are slighting Him, Still He is waiting,
Waiting the penitent child to receive:
Plead with them earnestly, Plead with them gently;
Will forgive if they only believe.
Rescue the perishing, &c.

Down in the human heart,
Crushed by the tempter,
Feelings lie buried that grace can restore;
Touched by a loving heart,
Wakened kindness,
Chords that were broken will vibrate once more
Rescue the perishing, &c.

Rescue the perishing;
Duty demands it;
Strength for Thy labor the LORD will provide:
Back to the narrow way
Patiently win them;
Tell the poor wanderer a SAVIOUR has died.
Rescue the perishing, &c.
