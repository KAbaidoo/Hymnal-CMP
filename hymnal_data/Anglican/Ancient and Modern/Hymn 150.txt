HYMN 150

JESU, our hope, our heart’s desire, Thy work of grace we sing;
Redeemer of the world art Thou,
Its maker and its King.

How vast the mercy and the love, Which laid our sins on Thee,
And led Thee to a cruel death,
To set Thy people free!

But now that bonds of death are burst;
The ransom has been paid;
and Thou art on Thy FATHER’s
In glorious robes arrayed.
And see Thy glory there!

JESU, our only Joy be Thou
As Thou our Prize wilt be;
In Thee be all our glory now
And through eternity.

All praise to Thee who art gone up triumphantly to Heav’n
All praise to GOD the FATHER’s Name And HOLY GHOST be given.
