HYMN 42 
 Thursday 
 
 The fish in wave, the bird on wing, 
 GOD bade the waters bear; 
 Each for our mortal body’s food 
 His gracious hands prepare. 
  
 
 But other food, of richer cost, 
 The immortal SPIRIT needs; 
 By faith it lives on every word 
 That from His mouth proceeds. 
  
 
 Faith springing from the blood of 
 Has flow’d o’er every land; [CHRIST] 
 And sinners through the vanquish’d 
 Bow down to its command. [world] 
 
 Its light the joy of heav’n reveals 
 To hearts made pure within; 
 And bids them seek by worthy deeds 
 Eternal crowns to win. 
  
 
 By faith the saints of old were strong 
 The lion’s wrath to tame; 
 By faith they spurn’d the tyrant’s threats 
 And scorn’d the raging flame. 
 
 LORD, grant that we the path may tread 
 Where on its light doth shine; 
 And gather as we onward go, 
 The fruits of love Divine. 
  
 
 O praise the FATHER; praise the SON, 
 On whose most precious blood 
 Rests all our faith; and praise to 
 Him Who with them both is GOD.
