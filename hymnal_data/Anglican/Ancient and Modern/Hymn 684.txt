HYMN 684

What are these that glow from afar
These that lean over the golden bar, Strong as the lion, pure as the dove, With open arms,
and hearts of love?
They the blessed ones gone before,
They the blessed for evermore;
Out of great tribulation they went
Home to their home of heav’n content.

What are these that fly as a cloud,
With flashing heads and faces bow’d; In their mouths a victorious psalm
In their hands a robe and a palm?
Welcoming Angels these that shine,
Your own Angel, and yours and mine;
Who have hedged us, both day and
night,
On the left hand and on the right.

Light above light, and bliss beyond
bliss, [this?
Whom words cannot utter, lo, who is
As a King with many crowns He
stands,
And our names are graven upon His
hands,
As a Priest, with GOD-uplifted eyes, He offers for us His sacrifice:
As the Lamb of GOD for sinners slain, That we too may live, He lives again.

GOD the FATHER give us grace
To walk in the light of JESU’s face; GOD the SON give us a part
In the hiding-place of JESU’s heart; GOD the SPIRIT so hold us up
That we may drink of JESU’s cup;
As our own Champion behold him
stand, [hand.
Strong to save us at GOD’s right.
