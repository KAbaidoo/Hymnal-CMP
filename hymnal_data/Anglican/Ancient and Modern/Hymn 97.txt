HYMN 97

Sing, my tongue, the glorious battle,
Sing the last, the dread array;
O’er the Cross, the Victor’s trophy,
Sound the high triumphal lay,
How, the pains of death enduring,
Earth’s Redeemer won the day.

He, our Maker, deeply grieving
That the first-made Adam fell,
When ate the fruit forbidden
Whose reward was death and hell,
Mark’d e’en then this Tree the
ruin Of the first tree to dispel.

Thus the work for our salvation
He ordained to be done;
To the traitor’s art opposing
Art yet deeper than his own;
Thence the remedy procuring
Whence the fatal wound begun.

Therefore, when at length the fullness
Of the appointed time was come,
He was sent, the world’s Creator,
From the FATHER’s heavenly home,
And was found in human fashion,
Offspring of the Virgin’s womb.

Lo! He lies, an infant weeping,
Where the narrow manger stands,
While the Mother-Maid His members
Wraps in mean and lowly bands
And the swaddling clothes is winding
Round His helpless Feet and Hands.
