HYMN 428

The Saints of GOD! their conflict past, And life’s long battle won at last,
No more they need the shield or
sword,
They cast them down before their
LORD:
O happy saints! forever blest,
At JESUS’ feet how safe your rest!

The Saints of GOD, their wanderings
done,
No more their weary course they run,
No more they faint, no more they fall,
No foes oppress, no fears appall:
O happy Saints! forever blest,
In that dear home how sweet your
rest!
The Saints of GOD! life’s voyage o’er, Safe landed on that blissful shore,
No stormy tempests now they dread,
No roaring billows lift their head:
O happy Saints! forever blest,
In that calm haven of your rest!

The Saints of GOD their vigil keep
While yet their mortal bodies sleep,
Til from the dust, they too shall rise And soar triumphant to the skies:
O happy Saints! rejoice and sing;
He quickly comes, your LORD and
King.

O GOD of Saints, to Thee we cry;
O SAVIOUR, plead for us on high;
O HOLY GHOST, our Guide and Friend,
Grant us Thy grace til life shall end; That with all saints our rest may be
In that bright Paradise with Thee.
