HYMN 360

THOU, Whose Almighty Word
Chaos and darkness heard,
And took their flight;
Hear us, we humbly pray,
And where the Gospel-day
Sheds not its glorious ray, Let there be light.

Thou, who didst come to bring On Thy redeeming wing
Healing and sight,
Health to the sick in mind, Sight to the inly blind,
Oh! now to all mankind
Let there be light.

SPIRIT of truth and love,
Life-giving, HOLY DOVE,
Speed forth Thy flight;
Move on the waters’ face,
Bearing the lamp of grace,
And in earth’s darkest place Let there be light.

Holy and Blessed Three,
Glorious Trinity,
Wisdom, Love, Might;
Boundless as ocean’s tide
Rolling in fullest pride,
Through the earth, far and wide, Let there be light.
