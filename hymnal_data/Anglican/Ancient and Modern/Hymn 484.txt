HYMN 484

Christians, sing out with exultation, And praise your benefactor’s Name!
Today the Author of salvation,
The FATHER’s well-beloved came,
Of undefiled Virgin Mother
An Infant, all divine, was born,
And GOD Himself became your
Brother
Upon this happy CHRISTmas morn.

In Him eternal might and power
To human weakness hath inclined;
And this poor Child brings richest dower
Of gifts and graces to mankind.
While here His Majesty disguising, A servant’s form the Master wears, Behold the beams
of glory rising
Even from His poverty and tears.

A stable serves Him for a dwelling, And for bed a manger mean;
Yet o’er His Head, His Advent
telling,
A new and wondrous star is seen.
Angels rehearse to men the story, The joyful story of His birth;
To Him they raise the anthem
-“Glory [earth!”
To GOD on high, and peace on

For through this holy incarnation The primal curse is done away;
And blessed peace o’er all creation Hath shed its pure and gentle ray.
Then, in that heavenly concert
joining,
O Christian men, with one accord, Your voices tunefully combining,
Salute the Birthday of your LORD!
