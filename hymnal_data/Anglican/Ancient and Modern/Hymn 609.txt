HYMN 609

Safe home safe home in port!
Rend cordage, shattered deck,
Torn sails, provision short,
And only not a wreck:
But oh! the joy upon the shore
To tell our voyage – perils o’er!

The prize, the prize secure!
The athlete nearly fell;
Bore all he could endure,
And bore not always well;
But he may smile at troubles gone
Who sets the victor's crown on.

No more the foe can harm,
No more of leaguered camp,
And cry of night alarm,
And need of ready lamp;
And yet how nearly had he failed-
How nearly had that foe prevailed!

The lamb is in the fold,
In perfect safety penned;
The lion once had hold,
And Thought to make an end;
But One came by with wounded side,
And for the sheep the Shepherd died.

The exile is at home!
O nights and days of tears,
O longings not to roam,
O sins and doubts and fears;
What matters now grief’s darkest day?
The King has wiped those tears away.
