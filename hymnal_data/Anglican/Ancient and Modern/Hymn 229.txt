HYMN 229

The roseate hues of early dawn,
The brightness of the day,
The crimson of the sunset sky,
How fast they fade away!
Oh for the pearly gates of Heav’n, Oh, for the golden floor,
Oh, for the sun of righteousness
That setteth nevermore!

The highest hope we cherish here, How fast they tire and faint:
How many a spot defiles the robe
That wraps an earthly saint!
Oh for a heart that never sins,
Oh for a soul wash’d white,
Oh, for a voice to praise our king, Nor weary day or night!

Here faith is ours, and heavenly
And grace to lead us higher:
But there are perfectness and peace, Beyond our best desire.
Oh, by Thy love and anguish, LORD, And by Thy life laid down,
Grant that we fail not from thee
Nor cast away our crown.
