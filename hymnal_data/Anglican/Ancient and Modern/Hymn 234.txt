HYMN 234

O Paradise! O Paradise!
Who doth not crave for rest?
Who would not seek the happy land Where they that loved are blest; Where loyal hearts and true
Stand ever in the light
All rapture through and through, In GOD’s most holy sight?

O Paradise! O Paradise!
The world is growing old;
Who would not be at rest and free Where love is never cold;
Where loyal hearts and true
Stand ever in the light,
All rapture through and through, In GOD’s most holy sight?

O Paradise! O Paradise!
‘Tis weary waiting here;
I long to be where JESUS is,
To feel, to see Him near;
Where loyal hearts and true
Stand ever in the light,
All rapture through and through, In GOD’s Most holy sight.

O Paradise! O Paradise!
I want to sin no more,
I want to be as pure on earth
As on Thy spotless shore;
Where loyal hearts and true
Stand ever in the light,
All rapture through and through, In GOD’s most holy sight.

O Paradise! O Paradise!
I greatly long to see
The special place my dearest LORD
In love prepare for me;
Where loyal hearts and true
Stand ever in the light,
All rapture through and through, In GOD’s most holy sight.

LORD JESU, King of Paradise,
O keep me in Thy love,
And guide me to that happy land Of perfect rest above;
Where loyal hearts and true
Stand ever in the light,
All rapture through and through, In GOD’s most holy sight.
