HYMN 656

Praise the LORD through every
nation;
His holy arm hath wrought salvation: Exalt Him on His FATHER’s Throne;
Praise your King, ye Christian
legions,
Who now prepares in heavenly regions Unfailing mansions for His own:
With voice and minstrelsy
Extol His majesty:
Hallelujah!
His praise shall sound all nature
round,
Where’er the race of man is found.

GOD with GOD dominion sharing,
And Man with man our image
bearing,
Gentile and Jew to Him are given:
Praise your SAVIOUR, ransom’d
sinners,
Of life, through Him immortal
winners;
No longer heirs of earth, but heaven.
O beatific sight
To view His face in light;
Hallelujah!
And, while we see, transformed to be From bliss to bliss eternally.

JESU, LORD, our Captain glorious,
O’er sin and death and hell victorious, Wisdom and might to Thee belong:
We confess, proclaim, adore Thee,
We bow the knee, we fall before Thee, Thy love henceforth shall be our Song: The cross
meanwhile we bear.
The crown ere long to wear.
Hallelujah!
Thy reign extend world without end, Let praise from all to Thee ascend.
