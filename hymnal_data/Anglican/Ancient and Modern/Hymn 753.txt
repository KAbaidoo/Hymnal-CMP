HYMN 753

All praise be to GOD,
Whom all things obey,
From Angels and men
Forever and aye:
Who sendeth on earth
The powers of His Throne,
His providence good
And love to make known.

His Angels are they
Of countenance fair,
The arm of His strength,
His hand of kind care:
His message of peace
To us they reveal,
His wisdom most high
They seal or unseal.

By Martyrs of old
They stood in the flame,
And bade them not flinch
But alone GOD’s name.
Through torment, through shame,
Through darkness or death
They led without fear
The faith of our faith.

They stand with the few,
They fight for the free,
GOD’s reign to advance
O’er land and o’er sea:
And when the brave die,
Or fall in the fight,
Their SPIRITS they bear
To rest in GOD’s sight.

For patience and toil
A crown they prepare;
They found for them eke
A kingdom full fair;
No famine nor plague
‘Gainst them doth prevail;
Their bread cannot lack
Their cruse cannot fail.

We pray Thee, who art
Thy angels’ reward,
Thy flock to defend
Forget not, O LORD:
But prosper their aid,
That us they may bring
To see the true face
Of JESUS, our King.
