HYMN 293

Sing praise to GOD who reigns
To GOD of all creation above, The GOD of power, the GOD of love,
The GOD of our salvation;
With healing balm my soul He fills, And every faithless murmur stills;
To GOD all praise and glory.

The Angel-host, O King of kings,
Thy praise forever telling,
In earth and sky all living things
Beneath Thy shadow dwelling,
Adore the wisdom which could span,
And power which formed creation’s plan;
To GOD all praise and glory.

What GOD’s Almighty power hath made
His gracious mercy keepeth; By morning glow or evening shade
His watchful eye ne’er sleepeth;
Within the kingdom of His might
Lo! all is just, and all is right;
To GOD all praise and glory.

Thus all my toilsome way along
I sing aloud Thy praises,
That men may hear the grateful Song My voice unwearied raises:
Be joyful in the LORD, my heart;
Both soul and body bear your part;
To GOD all praise and glory.
