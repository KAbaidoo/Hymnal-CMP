HYMN 571

Sing to the LORD the children’s
His gentle love declare, Who bends amid the Seraphim
To hear the children’s prayer.

He at a mother’s breast was fed,
Thou GOD’s own SON was He;
He learnt the first small words He
At a meek mother’s knee.

Close to His loving heart He pressed
The children of the earth;
He lifted up His hand and blessed
The babes of human birth.

Lo! from the stars His face will turn
On us with glances mild;
The Angels of His presence yearn
To bless the little child.

Keep us, O JESUS, LORD, for Thee,
That so, by Thy dear grace,
We, children of the font, may see
Our Heavenly FATHER’s face.
