HYMN 1

Now that the daylight fills the sky, 
We lift our hearts to God on high, 
That He, in all we do or say, 
Would keep us free from harm today

May He restrain our tongues from strife, 
And shield from anger's in our life, 
And guard with watchful care our eyes 
From earth's absorbing vanities

O may our inmost hearts be pure, 
From thoughts of folly kept secure, 
And pride of sinful flesh subdued 
Through sparing use of daily food

So we, when this day's work is o'er, 
And shades of night return once more 
Our path of trial safely trod,
Shall give the glory to our God

All praise to God the Father be, 
All praise, Eternal Son, to Thee 
Whom with the Spirit we adore 
Forever and forevermore
