HYMN 563 FOR AN ADULT

FATHER, SON, and HOLY GHOST,
In solemn power come down,
Present with Thy heavenly host
Thy Sacrament to crown:
See a sinful child of earth;
Bless for him the cleansing flood;
Make him by a second birth
One with the life of GOD.

Let the promised inward grace
Accompany the sign,
On his new-born soul impress
The glorious Name Divine
FATHER, all Thy love reveal
JESUS, all Thy mind impart,
HOLY GHOST, renew, and dwell
Forever in his heart.

For the Young
