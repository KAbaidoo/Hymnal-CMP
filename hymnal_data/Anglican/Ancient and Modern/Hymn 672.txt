HYMN 672

Holy SPIRIT, Truth divine,
Dawn upon this soul of mine;
Voice of GOD, and inward Light,
Wake my SPIRIT, clear my sight.

Holy SPIRIT, Love divine,
Glow within this heart of mine:
Kindle every high desire;
Perish self in Thy pure fire.

Holy SPIRIT, Power divine,
Fill and nerve this will of mine;
By Thee may I strongly live,
Bravely bear, and nobly strive.

Holy SPIRIT, Law divine,
Reign within this soul of mine:
By my law, and I shall be
Firmly bound, forever free.

Holy SPIRIT, Peace divine,
Still this restless heart of mine;
Speak to calm this tossing sea,
Stayed in Thy tranquility.

Holy SPIRIT, Joy divine
Gladden Thou this heart of mine;
In the desert ways I sing,-
Spring, O well, forever spring.
