HYMN 62

While shepherds watch’d their flocks by night,
All seated on the ground,
The angels of the Lord came down
And glory shone around

‘Fear not,” said he; for mighty dread
Had seized their troubled mind;
“Glad tidings of great joy
I bring To you and all mankind.

“To you in David’s town this day
Is born of David’s line
A SAVIOUR, who is CHRIST the LORD;
And this shall be the sign:

“The heavenly babe you there shall
To human view display’d,
Find All meanly wrapp’d in swathing
bands, And in a manger laid.’

Thus spoke the seraph; and forthwith
Appear’d a shining throng
Of Angels praising GOD,
Who thus Address’d their joyful Song:

“All glory be to GOD on high,
And to the earth be peace;
Good will henceforth from Heav’n to men
Begin and never cease.”
