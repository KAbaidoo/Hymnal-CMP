HYMN 298

Praise, my soul, the King of Heaven, To His feet thy tribute bring:
Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven, Evermore His praises sing:
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Praise the everlasting King.

Praise Him for His grace and favor To our fathers in distress;
Praise Him still the same as ever,
Slow to chide, and swift to bless;
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Glorious in His faithfulness.

Father-like, He tends and spares us, Well our feeble frame He knows;
In His hands He gently bears us,
Rescues us from all our foes;
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Widely yet His mercy flows.

Angels in the height, adore Him;
Behold Him face to face;
Saints triumphant, bow before Him;
Gathered in from every race;
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Praise with us the GOD of grace.
