HYMN 364

GOD of grace, O let Thy light
Bless our dim and blinded sight;
Like the day-spring on the night
Bid Thy grace to shine.

To the nations led astray
Thine eternal love display;
Let Thy truth direct their way
Til the world be thine.
Praise to Thee, the faithful LORD;
Let all tongues in glad accord
Learn the good thanksgiving word,
Ever praising Thee.

Let them move to gladness sing,
Owning Thee their judge and King
Righteous truth shall bloom and spring
Where Thy rule shall be.

Praise to Thee, all faithful LORD;
Let all tongues in glad accord
Speak the good thanksgiving word,
Heart-rejoicing praise.

So the fruitful earth’s increase,
Bounty of the GOD of peace,
Never in its course shall cease
Through the length of days.

While His grace our life shall cheer,
Furthest lands shall own His fear,
Brought to Him in worship near,
Taught His mercy’s ways.
