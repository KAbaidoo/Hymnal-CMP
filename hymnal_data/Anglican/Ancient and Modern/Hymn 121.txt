HYMN 121

And now, beloved LORD, Thy soul
resigning
Into Thy FATHER’s arms with con—
scious Will,
Calmly with reverend grace, Thy
Head inclining,
The throbbing brow and laboring
Breast grow still.

Freely Thy life Thou yieldest,
meekly bending
E’en to the last beneath our sorrows’
load,
Yet strong in death in perfect peace commending GOD, Thy SPIRIT too Thy FATHER
and Thy
Sweet SAVIOUR, in mine hour of
mortal anguish, When earth grows dim, and round
me fails the night, O breathe Thy peace, as flesh and
SPIRIT languish; At that dread eventide let there be
light.
To Thy dear cross turn Thou mine
eyes in dying; Lay but my fainting head upon Thy
Breast;
Those outstretched Arms receive my
latest sighing And then, oh! Then, thine everlasting Rest.
