HYMN 192

Love, who formed me to war
The image of Thy GODhead hear;
Who sought me with tender care
Thro’ all my wanderings wilds and dear;
O love, I give myself to Thee,
Thine ever, only thine to be,

O love, who ere life’s earliest dawn
On me Thy choice hast gently laid;
O love, who here as Man wast born;
And wholly like to us wast made;
O love, I give myself to Thee,
Thine ever, only thine to be,

O love, who once in time wast slain, [woe; Pierced through and through with bitter
O love, who wrestling thus didst gain
that eternal joy might know;
O love, I give myself to Thee,
Thine ever, only thine to be.

O love, who lovest me for aye,
Who for my soul dost ever plead;
O love, who didst that ransom pay
Whose power sufficeth in my stead;
O love, I give myself to Thee,
Thine ever, only thine to be.

O love, who once shalt bid me rise
From out this dying life of ours;
O love, who once o’er yonder skies
Shalt set me in the fadeless bowers;
O love, I give myself to Thee,
Thine ever, only thine to be.
