HYMN 513

O GOD of Truth, whose loving word, Upholds whate’er hath breath,
Look down on Thy creation, LORD,
Enslaved by sin and death.

Set up Thy standard, LORD, that
Who claim a heavenly birth may march with Thee to smite the
That vex Thy ransom’d earth.

Ah! would we join that blest array, And follow in the might
Of Him, the Faithful and the True, In raiment clean and white?

Then GOD of truth, for whom we
long—
Thou who wilt hear our prayer—
Do thine own battle in our hearts, And slay the falsehood there.

Year, come! then, tried as in the fire, From every lie set free,
Thy perfect truth shall dwell in us, And we shall live in Thee.
