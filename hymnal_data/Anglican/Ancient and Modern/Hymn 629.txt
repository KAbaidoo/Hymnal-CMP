HYMN 629

LORD, I hear of showers of blessing Thou art scattering full and free, Showers the thirsty
land refreshing; Let some drops descend on me
Even me.

Pass me not, O gracious FATHER,
Sinful though my heart may be;
Thou might’st leave me, but then rather
Let Thy mercy light on me-even

Pass me not, O gracious SAVIOUR!
Let me love and cling to Thee;
I am longing for Thy favour;
Whilst Thou art calling, oh call me Even me.

Pass me not, O gracious SAVIOUR!
Thou canst make the blind to see; Witnesser of JESU’s merit,
Speak the word of power to me Even me.
