HYMN 530

The voice of GOD’s creation found Perplex’d midst hope and fear, [me For Thou His
sunshine flash’d
around me,
His storms at times drew near: And I said_
Oh! that I knew where He abideth!
For doubts beset our lot,
And lo! His glorious face He hideth!
And men perceive it not!

The voice of GOD’s protection told He loveth all He made; [me I seem’d to feel His arms
enfold me, And yet was half afraid:
And I said_
Oh! that I knew where I might find Him!
His eye would guide me right;
He leaveth countless tracks behind Him,
Yet passeth out of sight.

The voice of conscience sounded nearer,
It stir’d my inmost breast;
But Though its tones were firmer, clearer,
“Twas not the voice of rest:
And I said_
Oh! that I knew if He forgiveth!
My soul is faint within,
Because in grievous fear it liveth Of wages due to sin.

It was the voice of revelation That met my utmost need;
The wondrous message of salvation Was joy and peace indeed:
And I said_
Oh! how I love the sacred pages From which such tidings flow,
As monarchs, patriarchs, poets, sages,
Have long’d in vain to know! For now is life a lucid story, And death a rest in Him,
And all is bathed in light and glory That once was dark or dim:
And I said_
O Thou who dost my soul deliver, And all its hopes uplift;
Give me a tongue to praise the giver, A heart to prize the gift.
