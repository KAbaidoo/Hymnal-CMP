HYMN 600 Quiet Day

Thou hidden love of GOD, whose
height,
whose depth unfathomed, no man
knows;
I see from far Thy beauteous light, Inly I sigh for Thy repose
My heart is pained, nor can it be
At rest, till it finds rest in Thee.

‘Tis mercy all, that Thou hast
brought
My mind to seek her peace in Thee;
Yet, while I seek but find Thee not, No peace my wandering soul shall
see;
O when shall all my wanderings end, And all my steps to Thee-ward tend?

Is there a thing beneath the sun
That strives with Thee my heart to
share?
Ah, tear it thence, and reign alone, The LORD of every motion there!
Then shall my heart from earth be
free,
When it hath found repose in Thee.

O hide this self from me, that I
No more, but CHRIST in me, may
live;
My vile affections crucify,
Nor let one hidden lust survive!
In all things nothing may I see,
Nothing desire, apart from Thee.

Each moment draw from earth away
My heart, that lowly waits Thy call:
Speak to my inmost soul, and say,
“I am Thy Love, Thy GOD, Thy All!”
To feel Thy power, to hear Thy voice, To taste Thy love, be all my choice.
