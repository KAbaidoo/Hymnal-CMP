HYMN 212

To Thee, O Comforter divine,
For all Thy grace and power benign,
sing we Alleluia!
To Thee, whose faithful love had place in God's great covenant of grace,
sing we Alleluia!
To Thee, whose faithful voice doth
Enlighten, sanctify, and seal,
sing we Alleluia!
To Thee, whose faithful truth is shown
By every promise made our own,
sing we Alleluia!
To Thee, our Teacher and our friend,
Our faithful Leader to the end,
sing we Alleluia!
To Thee, by Jesus Christ sent down,
Of all His gifts the sum and crown,
sing we Alleluia!
To Thee, who art with God the Son
And God the Father ever one,
sing we Alleluia!
