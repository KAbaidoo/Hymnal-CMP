HYMN 98
PALM SUNDAY

All glory, laud, and honor
To Thee, Redeemer, King,
To Whom the lips of children
Made sweet Hosannas ring.

Thou art the King of Israel,
Thou David’s Royal Son,
Who in the LORD’s Name comest,
The King and Blessed One.
All glory, etc.

The company of Angels
Are praising Thee on high,
And mortal men and all things
Created make reply.
All glory, etc.

The people of the Hebrews
With palms before Thee went;
Our praise and prayer and anthems
Before Thee we present.
All glory, etc.

To Thee before Thy Passion
They sang their hymns of praise;
To Thee now high exalted
Our melody we raise.
All glory, etc.

Thou didst accept their praises,
Accept the prayers we bring,
Who in all good delightest,
Thou good and gracious King.
All glory, etc.
