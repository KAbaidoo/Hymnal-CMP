HYMN 171

From highest Heav’n the Eternal
SON,
With GOD the FATHER ever One,
Came down to suffer and to die;
For love of sinful man He bore
Our human griefs and troubles sore,
Our load of guilt and misery

Rejoice, ye saints of GOD, and praise
The Lamb who died, His flock to raise
From sin and everlasting woe;
With Angels round the Throne above
O tell the wonders of His love,
The joys that from His mercy flow.

In darkest shades of night we lay,
Without a beam to guide our way,
Or hope of aught beyond the grave;
But He has brought us life and light;
And opened Heaven to our sight,
And lives forever strong to save.

Rejoice, ye saints of GOD, rejoice;
Sing out, and praise with cheerful voice
Adore The Lamb whom Heav’n and earth
To Him who gave His only SON,
To GOD the SPIRIT, with them one,
Be praise and glory evermore.
