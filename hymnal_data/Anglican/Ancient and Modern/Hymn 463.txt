HYMN 463 Last Things

GOD the FATHER, GOD the SON,
GOD the SPIRIT, THREE in ONE,
Hear us from Thy heavenly Throne, Spare us, Holy Trinity.

JESU, Life of those who die,
Advocate with GOD on high,
Hope of immortality,
Hear us, Holy JESU.

Thou before whose great white
Throne
All our doings must be shown,
Pleading now for us Thine own,
Hear us, Holy JESU,
Thou whose death was borne that from the power of Satan free, [we Might not die eternally,
Hear us, Holy JESUS.

Thou who dost a place prepare,
That in heavenly mansions fair
Sinners may Thy glory share,
Hear us, Holy JESUS.

DEATH
We are dying day by day;
Soon from earth we pass away;
LORD of life, to Thee we pray;
Hear us, Holy JESU,
Ere we hear the Angel’s call,
And the shadows round us fall,
Be our SAVIOUR, be our all;
Hear us, Holy JESU,
Wean our hearts from things below
Make us all Thy love to know,
Guard us from our ghostly foe;
Hear us, Holy JESU.

Shelter us with Angel’s wing,
To our souls Thy pardon bring;
So shall death have lost its sting: Hear us, Holy JESU.

In the gloom Thy light provide; Safely through the valley guide; Thee we trust, for Thou hast died: Hear us, Holy JESU.
