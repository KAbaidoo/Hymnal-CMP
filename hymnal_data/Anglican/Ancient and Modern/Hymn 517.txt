HYMN 517

WHEN all Thy mercies, O my GOD, My rising soul surveys,
Transported with the view, I’m lost In wonder, love, and praise.

Unnumbered comforts to my soul
Thy tender care bestowed,
Before my infant heart conceived From Whom those comforts flowed.

When in the slippery paths of youth With heedless steps I ran,
Thine arm unseen conveyed me safe, And led me up to man.

Through every period of my life Thy goodness I’ll pursue,
And after death in distant worlds The glorious theme renew.

Through all eternity to Thee
A joyful song I’ll raise;
But oh! eternity’s too short
To utter all Thy praise.
