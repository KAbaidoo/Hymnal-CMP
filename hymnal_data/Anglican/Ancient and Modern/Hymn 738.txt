HYMN 738

COME, labour on!
Who dares stand idle on the harvest
plain,
While all around him waves the
golden grain
And to each servant does the Master
“Go work today!”

Come, labour on!
Claim the high calling Angels cannot
share
To young and old the Gospel-glad—
ness bear:
Redeem the time: its hours too
swiftly fly,
The night draws nigh.

Come, labour on!
The enemy is watching night and
day
To sow the tares, to snatch the seed away;
While we in sleep our duty have
forgot,
He slumbered not.

Come, labour on!
Away with gloomy doubts and
faithless fear!
No arm so weak but may do service
here;
By feeblest agents can our GOD fulfill His righteous will.

Come, labour on!
No time for rest, till glows the
western sky,
Till the long shadows o’er our
pathway ……,
And a glad sound comes with the
setting sun—
“Servants, well done!”

Come, labour on!
The toil is pleasant, the reward is
sure
Blessed are those who to the end
endure;
Rest shall be,
O LORD, with Thee!
