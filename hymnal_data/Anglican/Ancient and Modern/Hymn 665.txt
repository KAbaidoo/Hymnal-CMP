HYMN 665

KING of glory, King of peace,
I will love Thee; And, that love may never cease
I will move Thee, Thou hast granted my request,
Thou hast heard me; Thou didst note my working breast,
Thou hast spared me.
Hallelujah.

Wherefore with my utmost art
I will sing Thee, And the cream of all my heart
I will bring Thee, Though my sins against me cried,
Thou didst clear me, And alone, when they replied,
Thou didst hear me.
Hallelujah.

Seven whole days, not one in seven,
I will praise Thee; In my heart, though not in heaven,
I can raise Thee. Small it is, in this poor sort
To enroll Thee; E’en eternity’s too short
To extol Thee.
Hallelujah.
