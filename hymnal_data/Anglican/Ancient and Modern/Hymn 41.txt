HYMN 41 
 Wednesday 
 
 New wonders of Thy mighty hand, 
 LORD, we today admire, 
 Writ on the firmament above 
 In glittering orbs of fire, 
  
 
 The sun is ruler of the day, 
 The silver moon of night, 
 The starry hosts adorn the sky 
 In ordered ranks of light. 
  
 
 But even that glorious sun must set, 
 And knows his going down, 
 That silver moon must wax and wane, 
 The stars their courses own. 
  
 
 Still in an ever-changing round 
 The daylight comes and goes; 
 But Thou art evermore the same, 
 No change Thy mercy knows. 
  
 
 Why waver then our troubled hearts? 
 Thine is a FATHER’s care; 
 And they eternal life who seek, 
 Eternal life shall share. 
  
 
 All praise, all glory be ascribed 
 To GOD the One in Three. 
 Who bids us cast our care on Him,
 To Him for comfort flee.
