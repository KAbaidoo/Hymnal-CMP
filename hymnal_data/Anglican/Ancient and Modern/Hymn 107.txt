HYMN 107

Glory be to JESUS,
Who, in bitter pains,
Poured for me the life-blood
From his sacred veins.

Grace and life eternal
In that blood I find;
Blest be his compassion
Infinitely kind.

Blest through endless ages
Be the precious stream,
Which from endless torments
Did the world redeem.

Abel’s blood for vengeance
Pleaded to the skies;
But the blood of JESUS
For our pardon cries.

Oft as it is sprinkled
On our guilty hearts,
Satan in confusion
Terror-struck departs;

Oft as earth exulting
Wafts its praise on high,
Angel hosts rejoicing
Make their glad reply.

Lift ye then your voices;
Swell the mighty flood;
Louder still and louder
Praise the precious blood.
