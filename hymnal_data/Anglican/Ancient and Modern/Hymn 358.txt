HYMN 358 Missions

From Greenland’s icy mountains, From India’s coral strand,
Where Africa’s sunny fountains
Roll down their golden sand,
From many an ancient river,
From many a palmy plain,
They call us to deliver
Their land from error’s chain.

What Though the spicy breezes
Blow soft o’er Ceylon’s isle,
Though every prospect pleases
And only man is vile,
In vain with lavish kindness
The gifts of GOD are strown,
The heathen in his blindness
Bows down to wood and stone.

Can we, whose souls are lighted With Wisdom from on high,
Can we to men benighted
The lamp of life deny?
Salvation! oh, salvation!
The joyful sound proclaim,
Til each remotest nation
Has learned Messiah’s name.

Waft, waft, ye winds, His story, And you, ye waters, roll,
Til, like a sea of glory,
It spreads from pole to pole;
Til o’er our ransom’d nature
The Lamb for sinners slain,
Redeemer, King, Creator,
In bliss returns to reign.
