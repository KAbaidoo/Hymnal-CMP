HYMN 716

I hunger and I thirst;
JESUS, my manna be;
Ye living waters, burst
Out of the rock for me.

Thou bruised and broken Bread, My life long wants supply;
As living souls are fed,
O feed me, or I die.

Thou true life-giving Vine,
Let me Thy sweetness prove;
Renew my life with thine,
Refresh my soul with love.

Rough paths my feet have trod Since first their course began; Feed me Thou Bread of GOD;
Help me, Thou Son of Man.

For still the desert lies
My thirsting soul before;
O living waters, rise
Within me evermore.
