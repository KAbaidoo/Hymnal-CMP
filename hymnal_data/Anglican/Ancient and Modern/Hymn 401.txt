HYMN 401

Now the laborer’s task is o’er;
Now the battle day is past;
Now upon the farther shore
Lands the voyager at last.
FATHER, in Thy gracious keeping
Leave we now Thy servant sleeping.

There the tears of earth are dried;
There its hidden things are clear;
There the work of life is tried
By a juster Judge than here.
FATHER, in Thy gracious keeping
Leave we now Thy servant sleeping.

There the sinful souls, that turn to the Cross their dying eyes
All the love of CHRIST shall learn at his Feet in Paradise.
FATHER, in Thy gracious keeping
Leave we now Thy servant sleeping.

There no more the powers of hell
Can prevail to mar their peace;
CHRIST the LORD shall guard them
He Who died for their release.
FATHER, in Thy gracious keeping
Leave we now Thy servant sleeping.

“Earth to earth, and dust to dust,”
Calmly now the words we say,
Leaving him to sleep in trust
Til the Resurrection-day
FATHER, in Thy gracious keeping
Leave we now Thy servant sleeping.
