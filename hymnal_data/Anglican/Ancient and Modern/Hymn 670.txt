HYMN 670

Come down, O Love Divine,
Seek Thou this soul of mine,
And visit it with Thine own ardor glowing;
O Comforter, draw near,
Within my heart appear,
And kindle it. Thy holy flame
bestowing.

O let it freely burn,
Til earthly passions turn
To dust and ashes in its heat consuming; And let Thy glorious light
Shine ever on my sight,
And clothe me round, the while my path illuminating.

Let holy charity
Mine outward vesture be
And lowliness become mine inner
clothing; True lowliness of heart,
Which takes the humbler part,
And o’er its own shortcomings weeps with loathing.

And so the yearning strong,
With which the soul will long,
Shall far out pass the power of human telling;
For none can guess its grace,
Til he become the place
Wherein the HOLY SPIRIT makes His dwelling.
