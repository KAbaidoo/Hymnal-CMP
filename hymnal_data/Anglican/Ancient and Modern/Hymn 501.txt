HYMN 501

Far be sorrow, tears, and sighing!
Waves are calming, storms are dying; Moses hath o’erpass’d the sea,
Israel’s captive hosts are free;
Life by death slew death and saved us, In His blood the Lamb hath laved us, Clothing us
with victory.

JESUS CHRIST from death hath risen,
Lo! His GODhead bursts the prison,
While His Manhood passes free,
Vanquishing our misery.
Rise we free from condemnation;
Through our GOD’s humiliation,
Ours is now the victory.

Vain the foe’s despair and madness!
See the dayspring of our gladness!
Slaves no more of Satan we;
Children, by the SON set free;
Rise, for Life with death hath striven, All the snares of hell are riven,
Rise and claim the victory.
