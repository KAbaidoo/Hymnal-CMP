HYMN 37

This is the day of light;
Let there be light today;
O day-spring, rise upon our night,
And chase its gloom away,

This is the day of rest;
Our failing strength renew;
On weary brain and troubled breast Shed
Thou Thy freshening dew.

This is the day of peace;
Thy peace our spirits fill;
Bid Thou the blasts of discord cease,
The waves of strife be still.

This is the day of prayer;
Let earth to heaven draw near;
Lift up our hearts to seek Thee there,
Come down to meet us here.

This is the first days;
Send forth Thy quickening breath
And wake dead souls to love and
praise O vanquisher of death.
