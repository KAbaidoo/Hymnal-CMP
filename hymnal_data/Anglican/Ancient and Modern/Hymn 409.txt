HYMN 409

Praise we the LORD this day.
This day so long foretold,
Whose promise shone with cheering
On waiting saints of old.

The Prophet gave the sign
For faithful men to read;
A virgin, born of David’s line,
Shall bear the promised seed.

Ask not how this should be,
But worship and adore;
Like her, whom Heaven’s Majesty
Came down to shadow o’er.

Meekly she bowed her head
To hear the gracious word,
Mary, the pure and lowly maid,
The favored of the LORD.

Blessed shall be her name
In all the Church on earth,
Through whom that wondrous mercy came,
The incarnate SAVIOUR’s birth.

JESU, the virgin’s SON,
We praise Thee and adore,
Who art with GOD the FATHER One
And SPIRIT evermore.

St. Mark the Evangelist
