HYMN 158 Trinity Sunday

All hail, adored Trinity;
All hail, Eternal Unity;
O GOD the FATHER, GOD the SON,
And GOD the SPIRIT, ever One.

Behold to Thee, this festal day,
We meekly pour our thankful lay;
O let our work accepted be,
That sweetest work of praising Thee.

Three persons praise we evermore, One only GOD our hearts adore;
In Thy sure mercy ever kind
May we our true protection find.

O Trinity! O Unity!
Be present as we worship thee;
And with the songs that Angels sing Unite the hymns of praise we bring.
