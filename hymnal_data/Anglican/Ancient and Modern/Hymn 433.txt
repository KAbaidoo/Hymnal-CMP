HYMN 433

Behold the messengers of CHRIST, Who bear to every place
The unveiled mysteries of GOD,
The Gospel of His grace.

The things through mists and shadows By holy prophets seen,
In the full light of day they saw With not a cloud between.

What CHRIST, true Man, divinely wrought,
What GOD in Manhood bore, They wrote, as GOD inspired, in words
That live forevermore.

Although in space and time apart, One SPIRIT ruled them all;
And in their sacred pages still
We hear that SPIRIT’s call.

To GOD, the Blessed THREE in ONE, Be glory, praise, and might,
Who called us from the shades of death To His own glorious light.
