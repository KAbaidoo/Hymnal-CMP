HYMN 519

GOD the FATHER’s only SON,
And with Him in glory One,
One in wisdom, One in might,
Absolute and Infinite;
JESUS, I believe in Thee,
Thou art LORD and GOD to me.

Preacher of eternal peace,
CHRIST anointed to release,
Setting wide the dungeon door
Unto sinners chain’d before;
JESUS, I believe in Thee,
CHRIST the Prophet sent to me.

Low in deep Gethsemane,
High on dreadful Calvary,
In the Garden, on the Cross,
Making good our utter loss;
JESUS, I believe in Thee,
Priest and Sacrifice for me.

Ruler of Thy ransom’d race,
And Protector by Thy grace,
Leader in the way we wend,
And rewarder at the end;
JESUS, I believe in Thee,
CHRIST, the King of kings to me.
