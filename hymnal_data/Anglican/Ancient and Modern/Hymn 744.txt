HYMN 744 Processional
Glory to the First-begotten,
Risen CHRIST, Incarnate Word!
Glory to the Faithful Witness,
Over all dominion LORD,
Who hath loved us, Who hath washed
In His precious blood outpoured!

Glory unto Him who gave us
Heritage of priest and king!
That forever in His presence
We our Eucharist may sing,
All our crowns cast down before Him
To His shrine our incense bring.

Glory to the LORD Almighty!
Every foe beneath Him cast,
High He reigns in splendor seated,
He the First and He the Last,
He both Alpha and Omega,
LORD of Future, present, past.

Glory unto Him who holdeth
Mystic stars in His right hand!
Glory unto Him who walketh
'Midst the lamps that gleaming stand!
Ever Church and every pastor
Subject to His dread command.

Thou who knowest how we labored,
Fainting not when foemen strove,
Raise once more our faltering courage,
Stir again our early love:
Quench not all the light within us,
Nor our candlestick remove.

From all subtle evil guard us,
False apostles, deeds of ill:
Grant us every lie to conquer,
Every hateful lust to kill:
By the Tree of Life sustain us,
And our hungry SPIRITS fill.

If, wherever Satan dwelleth,
We confess Thee as our LORD,
Bid us fear not Satan's malice,
Tribulation, fire, or sword.
Crown Thy faithful patient servants
With the Martyr's bright reward.

By the Holy SPIRIT cleanse us,
Pure in heart Thy law to own;
Grant to us the hidden manna,
Grant to us the fair white stone,
And the new name newly written,
Only to Thy servants known.

Thou hast once for our salvation
On the raging Dragon trod,
Keep us steadfast, faithful, loving,
Smite our foes with iron rod,
Scatter all the depths of Satan,
Bright and Morning Star of GOD.

Save us from the name of loving
While the soul within is dead;
Wash our garments from defilement
In the Blood that Thou hast shed;
Then confess us in Thy glory.
