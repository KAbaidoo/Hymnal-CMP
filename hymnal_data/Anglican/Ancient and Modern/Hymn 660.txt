HYMN 660

Almighty FATHER, Unoriginate,
Whom no man hath seen ever, nor
can see;
Who reignest Bles’d and Only Potent—
Light unapproachable encircling
Thee;
Almighty FATHER, hallowed be Thy
Name,
Whoever art, unchangeably the
same.

Thou lovest us else had we never
been:
Before we were, in ages long ago,
Thy love had us all our wants
foreseen,
Creating us that we Thy love might
know.

Yea, FATHER, Thou,… whom we live
and move,
Hast loved us with an everlasting love.

Thou madest man immortal at the
first,
An image own eternity;
And when he fell from life, through
sin accurst,
And lost his right to the life-giving tree,
Thy love, unconquered, would to him
restore
His life ennobled and forevermore.

Such was Thy love Thou didst not
even spare
Thy Best-beloved, but gav’st Him
for us all;
To live that human life beyond
compare,
And dying, by His blood retrieve our
fall.
In Him Thy love unbounded we
behold,
For giving Him, Thou canst not
aught withhold.

Thou knowest what we are, how
frail and blind,
Thou still rememb’rest that we are
but dust:
Like as a FATHER………., Thou art
kind,
Thy justice kindnes, and Thy kindnes just.
Then hear Thy children’s prayer
from heav’n Thy Throne;
FATHER, Thy kingdom come;
Thy will be done.
