HYMN 182

JESU, grant me this, I pray,
Ever in Thy Heart to stay;
Let me evermore abide
Hidden in Thy wounded Side,

If the evil one prepare,
Or the world, a tempting snare, I am safe when I abide
In Thy Heart and wounded Side,
If the flesh, more dangerous still, Tempt my soul to deeds of ill, Nought I fear when I abide
In Thy Heart and wounded Side,
Death will come one day to me; JESU, cast me not from Thee:
Dying let me still abide
In Thy Heart and wounded Side.
