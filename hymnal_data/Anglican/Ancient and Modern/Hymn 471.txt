HYMN 471 Church
GOD the FATHER, GOD the SON,
GOD the SPIRIT, Three in One,
Hear us from Thy heavenly Throne,
Spare us, Holy Trinity.

JESU, with Thy Church abide,
Be her safe from every foe,
Comfort her in time of woe:
We beseech Thee, hear us.

Arms of love around her throw,
Shield her safe from every foe,
Comfort her in time of woe:
We beseech Thee, hear us.

Keep her life and doctrine pure,
Grant her patience to endure,
Trusting in Thy promise sure:
We beseech Thee, hear us.

May her voice be ever clear,
Warning of a judgment near,
Telling of a SAVIOUR dear:
We beseech Thee, hear us.

All her fettered powers release,
Bid our strife and envy cease,
Grant the heavenly gift of peace
We beseech Thee, hear us.

All that she has lost restore,
May her strength and zeal be more
Than in brightest days of yore:
We beseech Thee, hear us.

May she one in doctrine be,
One in truth and charity,
Winning all to faith in Thee;
We beseech Thee, hear us.

May she guide the poor and blind,
Seek the lost until she find,
And the broken-hearted bind:
We beseech Thee, hear us.

May her Priests the people feed,
Shepherds of the flock indeed,
Ready, where Thou cal’st, to lead:
We beseech Thee, hear us.

Judge her not for work undone,
Judge her not for fields unwon,
Bless her works in Thee begun:
We beseech Thee, hear us.
