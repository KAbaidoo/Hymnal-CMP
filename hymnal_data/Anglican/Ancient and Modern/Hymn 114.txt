HYMN 114

O come and mourn with me awhile;
O come ye to the Saviour’s side;
O come, together let us mourn;
JESUS, our LORD, is crucified.

Have we no tears to shed for Him,
While soldiers scoff and Jews deride?
Ah! Look how patiently He hangs;
JESUS, our LORD, is crucified.

How fast His hands and feet are nailed;
His throat with parching thirst is dried,
His failing eyes are dimmed with Blood; JESUS, our LORD, is crucified.

Seven times He spake, seven Words of love;
And all three hours His silence cried For mercy on the souls of men;
JESUS, Our LORD, is crucified.

Come, let us stand beneath the Cross; So may the Blood from out His side
Fall gently on us drop by drop;
JESUS, our LORD, is crucified.

A broken heart, a fount of tears,
Ask, and they will not be denied;
LORD JESUS, may we love and weep.
Since Thou for us art crucified.
