HYMN 424

They come, GOD’s messengers of
love,
They come from realms of peace above, From homes of never-fading light,
From blissful mansions ever bright.

They come to watch around us here,
to soothe our sorrow, calm our fear; Ye heavenly guides, speed not away,
GOD willeth you with us to stay.

But chiefly at its journey’s end
‘Tis yours the SPIRIT to befriend,
And whisper to the faithful heart,
“O Christian soul, in peace depart.”

Blest JESU, Thou whose groans and
tears
Have sanctified frail nature’s fears, To earth in bitter sorrow weighed,
Thou didst not scorn thine Angel’s
aid;

An Angel guard to us supply,
When on the bed of death we lie;
And by thine own Almighty power
O shield us in the last dread hour.

To GOD the FATHER, GOD the SON,
And GOD the SPIRIT, THREE in ONE,
From all above and all below
Let joyful praise unceasing flow.

These Hymns on the ministry of
Angels may be sung, if desired, at
other times.

St. Luke the Evangelist
