HYMN 760

O Wondrous type, O vision fair
Of glory that the Church shall share, Which CHRIST upon the mountain
show, glows!

From age to age the tale declare,
How with the three disciples there
Where Moses and Elias meet,
The LORD hold converse high and sweet.

The Law and Prophets there have place,
The chosen witnesses of grace;
The FATHER’s voice from out the cloud
Proclaims His only SON aloud.

With shining face and bright array, CHRIST deigns to manifest today
What glory shall to faith be given
When we enjoy our GOD in heaven.

And Christian hearts are raised on high
By that great vision’s mystery,
For which in thankful strains we raise On this glad day the voice of praise.

O FATHER, with th’ Eternal SON
And Holy SPIRIT ever One,
Vouchsafe to bring us by the grace
To see Thy glory face to face.
