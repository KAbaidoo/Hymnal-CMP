HYMN 174

We saw Thee not when Thou didst 
come to this poor world of sin and 
Nor e’er beheld Thy cottage-home 
In that despised Nazareth; 
But we believe Thy footsteps trod 
Its streets and plains, Thou SON of 
GOD. 
We did not see Thee lifted high 
Amid that wild and savage crew, 
Nor heard Thy meek, imploring cry, 
“Forgive, they know not what they 
do;” 
Yet we believe the deed was done, 
Which shook the earth and veiled 
the sun, 
We stood not by the empty tomb 
Where late Thy sacred Body lay, 
Nor sat within that upper room, 
Nor met Thee in the open way; 
But we believe that Angels said, 
“Why seek the living with the dead?”

We did not mark the chosen few, 
When Thou didst through the cloud 
ascend, First lift to Heav’n their wondering 
view, 
Then to the earth all prostrate bend; Yet we believe that mortal eyes 
Beheld that journey to the skies.

And now that Thou dost reign on 
high, 
And thence Thy waiting people bless, No ray of glory from the sky 
Doth shine upon our wilderness; 
But we believe Thy faithful Word, 
And trust in our Redeeming LORD.
