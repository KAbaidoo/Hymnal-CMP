HYMN 4

New every morning is the love 
Our waking and uprising prove; 
Through sleep and darkness safely brought, 
Restored to life and power, and Thought.

New mercies, each returning day, 
Hover around us while we pray; 
New perils past, new sins forgiven,
New Thoughts of GOD, new hopes of Heav’n. 

If on our daily course our mind 
Be set to hallow all we find, 
New treasures still of countless price, 
GOD will provide for sacrifice. 

The trivial round, the common task, 
Will furnish all we need to ask 
Room to deny ourselves, a road 
To bring us daily nearer GOD.

Only, O LORD, in Thy dear love 
Fit us for perfect rest above; 
And help us, this and every day, 
To live more nearly as we pray.
