HYMN 258

I was a wandering sheep,
I did not love the fold,
I did not love my Shepherd’s voice, I would not be control’d
I was a wayward child,
I did not love my home,
I did not love my FATHER’s voice, I loved afar to roam.

The Shepherd sought His sheep,
The FATHER sought His child,
They followed me o’er vale and hill, O’er deserts waste and wild;
They found me nigh to death,
Famished and faint, and lone;
They bound me with the bands of love,
They saved the wandering one.

They spoke in tender love,
They raised my drooping head,
They gently closed my bleeding
wounds,
My fainting soul they fed;
They washed my filth away,
They made me clean and fair;
They brought me to my home in peace The long-sought wanderer.

JESUS my Shepherd is,
‘Twas He that loved my soul
‘Twas He that washed me in His Blood ‘Twas He that made me whole;
‘Twas He that sought the lost,
That found the wandering sheep; ‘Twas He that brought me to the ‘Tis He that still doth
keep. [fold,
I was a wandering sheep,
I would not be control’d ;
But now I love my Shepherd’s voice, I love, I love the fold.
I was a wayward child,
I once preferred to roam;
But now I love my FATHER’s voice, I love, I love His home.
