HYMN 143

LORD, in Thy name Thy servants 
Plead, 
And Thou hast sworn to hear; 
Thine is the harvest, thine the sea, The fresh and fading year. 

Our hope, when Autumn winds blew 
We trusted, LORD, with Thee: Wild, And still, now spring has on us 
We wait on Thy decree. 

The former and the latter rain, 
The summer sun and air, 
The green ear, and the golden grain, All thine, are ours by prayer. 

Thine too by right, and ours by grace, The wondrous growth unseen, 
The hopes that soothe, the fears that The love that shines serene. 

So grant the precious things brought By sun and moon below, 
That Thee in Thy new Heaven and 
We never may forego.
