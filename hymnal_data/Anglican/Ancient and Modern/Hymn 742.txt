HYMN 742 WAR

GOD the unalterable! King, who
ordainest
Great winds Thy clarions, the
lightnings Thy sword, Show forth pity on nigh where
Thou reignest, LORD.
Grant to us peace, O most merciful

GOD the Omnipotent: Mighty
Avenger heard, Watching invisible, judging un—
Doom us not now in the day of our
danger; LORD
Grant to us peace, O most merciful

GOD the All-merciful! earth has
forsaken
Thy ways of blessedness slighted
Thy word;

Bid not Thy wrath in its terrors
awaken; LORD, Grant to us peace, O most merciful

So shall Thy children in thankful
devotion,
Praise Him who saved them from
peril and sword: Singing in chorus from ocean to ocean
Peace to the nations, and praise to
the LORD.
