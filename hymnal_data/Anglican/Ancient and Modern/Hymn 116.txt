HYMN 116

“LORD, when the kingdom comes,
remember me!”
Thus spake the dying lips to dying
Ears;
O faith, which in that darkest hour
could see
The promised glory of the far-off
years!

No kingly sign declares that glory
now,
No ray of hope lights up that awful
hour;
A thorny crown surrounds the bleeding Brow,
The Hands are stretched in weakness,
not in power.
Yet hear the Word the dying SAVIOUR
saith,
“Thou too shalt rest in Paradise today;’
O words of love to answer words of
faith!
O words of hope for those who live
to pray!

LORD, when with dying lips my
prayer is said, Grant that in faith Thy kingdom I
may see;
And, thinking on Thy cross and
bleeding head, May breathe my parting words,
“Remember me.”

Remember me, but not my shame or
sin;
Thy cleansing blood hath washed
them all away; Thy precious death for me did
pardon win;
Thy blood redeemed me in that
awful day.

Remember me; yet how canst Thou
forget to Thee, What pain and anguish I have caused
The cross, the Agony, the bloody
Sweat,
And all the sorrow Thou didst bear
for me?

Remember me; and ere I pass away,
Speak Thou the assuring word that
sets us free,
And make Thy promise to my heart,
“To-day
Thou too shalt rest in Paradise with
Me.”
