HYMN 294

O praise our Great and Gracious
And call upon His Name; [LORD,
To strains of joy tune every chord, His mighty acts proclaim;
Tell how He led His chosen race
To Canaan’s promised land;
Tell how His covenant of grace
Unchanged shall ever stand.

He gave the shadowing cloud by
The moving fire by night; [day, To guide His Israel on their way,
He made their darkness light;
And have not we a sure retreat,
A SAVIOUR ever nigh, [feet, The same clear light to guide our
The Day-spring from on high?

We too have manna from above,
The Bread that came from Heav’n
To us the same kind hand of love
Hath living waters given; [spring A rock we have, from whence the
Is rich abundance flows;
That Rock is CHRIST, our Priest, our King,
Who ……… and health bestows.

O may we prize this blessed food,
And trust our heavenly guide;
So shall we find death’s fearful flood Serene as Jordan’s tide,
And safely reach that happy shore, The land of peace and rest,
Where Angels worship and adore
In GOD’s own presence blest.
