HYMN 418

For all Thy saints, a noble throng,
Who fell by fire and sword,
Who soon were called, or waited long, We praise Thy Name, O LORD.
For him who left his FATHER’s side,
Nor lingered by the shore
When, softer than the weltering tide, Thy summons gilded o’er;

Who stood beside the maiden dead,
Who climbed by the shore,
And saw the glory round Thy head,
One of Thy chosen three;

Who knelt beneath the olive shade,
Who drank Thy cup of pain,
And passed from Herod’s flashing blade
To see Thy face again.

LORD, give us grace, and give us love,
Like to leave behind Earth’s cares and joys, and look
With true and earnest mind.

So shall we learn to drink Thy cup,
So meek and firm be found,
When Thou shalt come to take us up
Where thine elect are crowned.

St. Bartholomew the Apostle
