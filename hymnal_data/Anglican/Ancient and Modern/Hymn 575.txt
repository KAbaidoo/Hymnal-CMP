HYMN 575

Within the churchyard, side by side, Are many long low graves;
And some have stones set over them, On some the green grass waves.

Full many little Christian child, Women, and man, lies there;
And we pass near them every time. When we go in to prayer.

They cannot hear our footsteps come, They do not see us pass;
They cannot feel the warm bright. That shines upon the grass. [sun

They do not hear when the great bell Is ringing overhead;
They cannot rise and come to Church With us, for they are dead.

But we believe a day shall come
When all the dead will rise,
When they who sleep down in the
Will ope again their eyes. [grave

For CHRIST our LORD was buried
He died and rose again, [once, He conquer’d death, He left the
And so will Christian men. [grave;

So when the friends we love the
Lie in their churchyard bed, [best
We must not cry too bitterly
Over the happy dead;

Because, for our dear SAVIOUR’s
Our sins are all forgiven; [sake, And Christians only fall asleep
To wake again in Heav’n.
