HYMN 691

Quiet, LORD, my forward heart;
Make me teachable and mild,
Upright, simple, free from art;
Make me as a weaned child,
From distrust and envy free,
Pleased with all that pleases Thee.

What Thou shalt to-day provide,
Let me as a child receive:
What to-morrow may betide,
Calmly Thy wisdom leave;
‘Tis enough that Thou wilt care:
Why should I the burden bear?

As a little child relies
On a care beyond his own
Knows he’s neither strong nor wise, Fears to stir a step alone;
Let me thus with Thee abide,
As my FATHER, Guard, and Guide.
