HYMN 645

Sinful, sighing to be blest;
Bound, and longing to be free;
Weary, waiting for my rest;
GOD, be merciful to me.

Goodness I have none to plead,
Sinfulness in all I see,
I can only bring my need;
GOD, be merciful to me.

Broken heart and downcast eyes
Dare not lift themselves to Thee;
Yet Thou canst interpret sighs:
GOD, be merciful to me.

From this sinful heart of mine
To Thy bosom I would flee;
I am not my own, but thine;
GOD, be merciful to me.

There is one beside the Throne,
And my only hope and plea
Are in Him, and Him alone:
GOD, be merciful to me.

He my cause will undertake,
My interpreter will be;
He’s my all; and for His sake,
GOD, be merciful to me.
