HYMN 123

By JESUS’ grave on either hand,
While night is brooding o’er the
Land
The sad and silent mourners stand,

At last the weary life is o’er,
The agony and conflict sore
Of Him who all our sufferings bore.

Deep in the rock’s sepulchral shade
The LORD, by whom the worlds were
The SAVIOUR of mankind, is laid.
O hearts bereaved and sore distressed
Here is for you a place of rest;
Here leave your griefs on JESUS’
breast.
