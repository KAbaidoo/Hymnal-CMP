HYMN 703

Beloved, let us love: love is of GOD; In GOD alone hath love its true 
abode.

Beloved, let us love: for they who love, They only, are His Sons, born from 
above.

Beloved, let us love: for love is rest, And he who loveth not abides unblessed.

Beloved, let us love: for love is light, And he who loveth not dwelleth in 
night.

Beloved, let us love: for only thus 
Shall we behold that GOD Who 
loveth us.
