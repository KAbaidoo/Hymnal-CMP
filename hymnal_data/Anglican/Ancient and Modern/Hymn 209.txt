HYMN 209

Come, gracious SPIRIT, heavenly
dove,
With light and comfort from above;
Be Thou our Guardian, Thou our
guide,
O’er every thought and step preside.

The light of truth to us display,
And make us know and choose Thy
way;
Plant holy fear in every heart,
That we from GOD may ne’er depart.

Lead us to CHRIST, the living way,
Nor let us from His pastures stray;
Lead us to holiness, the road
That we must take to dwell with GOD.

Lead us to Heav’n, that we may share
Fullness of joy for ever there;
Lead us to GOD, our final rest,
To be with Him for ever blest.
