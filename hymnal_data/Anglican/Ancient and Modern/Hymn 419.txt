HYMN 419

King of saints, to whom the number Of Thy starry host is known,
Many a name, by man forgotten,
Lives forever round Thy Throne;
Lights, which earth-born mists have darkened,
There are shining full and clear,
Princes in the court of Heaven,
Nameless, unremembered here.

In the roll of thine Apostles
One there stands, Bartholomew,
He for whom today we offer,
Year by year, our praises due;
How he toiled for Thee and suffered None on earth can now record;
All his saintly life is hidden
In the knowledge of his LORD.

Was it he, beneath the fig-tree
Seen of Thee, and guileless found; He who saw the good he longed for
Rise from Nazareth’s barren ground; He who met his risen Master
On the shore of Galilee;
He to whom the Word was spoken,
“Greater things Thou yet shalt see”?

None can tell us; all is written
In the Lamb’s great book of life,
All the faith, and prayer, and patience, All the toiling, and the strife;
There are told Thy hidden treasures; Number us, O LORD, with them
When Thou makest up the jewels
Of Thy living Diadem.

St. Matthew the Apostle
