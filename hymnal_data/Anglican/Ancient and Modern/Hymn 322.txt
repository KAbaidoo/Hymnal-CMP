HYMN 322

And now, O FATHER, mindful of the
love
That bought us, once for all, on Calvary’s Tree,
And having with us Him that pleads
above,
We here present, we here spread
forth to Thee
That only offering perfect in thine eyes,
The one true, pure, immortal sacrifice.

Look, FATHER, look on His anointed
Face,
And only look on us as found in Him:
Look not on our misusing of Thy
grace, so dim;
Our prayer so languid, and our faith
For lo! between our sins and their
reward
We set the passion of Thy SON our
LORD.

And then for those, our dearest and
our best,
By this prevailing presence we
appeal;
O fold them closer to Thy mercy’s
breast,
O do thine utmost for their souls’
true weal;
From tainting mischief keep them
White and clear,
And crown Thy gifts with strength
to persevere.

And so we come; O draw us to Thy
feet,
Most patient SAVIOUR, who canst
love us still;
And by this Food, so awful and so
sweet,
Deliver us from ever touch of ill:
In thine own service make us glad
and free,
And grant us never more to part
with Thee.
