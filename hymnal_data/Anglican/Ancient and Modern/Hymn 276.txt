HYMN 276

O LORD, how happy should we be
If we could cast our care on Thee, If we from self could rest;
And feel at heart that one above, In perfect wisdom, perfect love, Is working for the best.

How far from this our daily life, How oft disturb’d by anxious strife, By sudden wild alarms;
Oh, could we but relinquish all
Our earthly props, and simply fall On Thy Almighty arms!
Could we but kneel, and cast our load,
E’en while we pray, upon our GOD, Then rise with lightened cheer;
Sure that the FATHER, who is nigh To still the famished raven’s cry, Will hear in that we fear.

We cannot trust Him as we should; So chafes weak nature’s restless mood To eat its peace away [preach, But birds and flowerets round us all, all the present evil teach
Sufficient for the day.

LORD, make these faithless hearts of ours Such lessons learn from birds and flowers;
Make them from self to cease;
Leave all things to a FATHER’s will, And taste before Him lying still, E’en in affliction, peace.
