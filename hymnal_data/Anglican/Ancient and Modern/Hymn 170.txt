HYMN 170

JESUS is GOD: the solid earth,
The ocean broad and bright,
The countless stars, like golden dust, That strew the skies at night,
The wheeling storm, the dreadful fire, The pleasant wholesome air,
The summer’s sun, the winter’s frost, His own creations were.
JESUS is GOD: the glorious bands
Of golden Angels sing
songs of adoring praise to Him,
Their maker and their King.
He was true GOD in Bethlehem’s crib, On Calvary’s cross true GOD;
He, who in heaven Eternal reign’d, In time on earth abode.
