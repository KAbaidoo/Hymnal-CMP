HYMN 82
For the Week before Septuagesima

Hallelujah, Song of sweetness,
Voice of joy that cannot die;
Hallelujah is the anthem
Ever dear to choirs on high;
In the house of GOD abiding
Thus they sing eternally.

Hallelujah Thou resoundest,
True Jerusalem and free;
Hallelujah, joyful Mother,
All Thy children sing with Thee;
But by Babylon’s sad waters
Mourning exiles now are we.

Hallelujah cannot always
Be our Song while here below;
Hallelujah our transgressions
Make us for a while forego;
For the solemn time is coming
When our tears for sin must flow.

Therefore in our hymns we pray
Grant us, blessed Trinity,
Thee, At the last to keep thine Easter
In our Home beyond the sky,
There to Thee forever singing
Hallelujah joyfully.
