HYMN 78

The heavenly child stature grows,
And, growing, learns to die;
And still His early training
shows His coming agony.

The SON of GOD His glory hides
With parents mean and poor;
And He, who made the heavens,
In dwelling place obscure.

Those mighty hands that rule the
sky No earthly toil refuse;
The maker of the stars on high
An humble trade pursues.

He, whom the choirs of Angels
Praise
Bearing each dread decree,
His earthly parents now obeys
In deep humility.

For this Thy lowliness revealed JESU,
we Thee adore,
And praise to GOD the FATHER
yield And SPIRIT evermore.
