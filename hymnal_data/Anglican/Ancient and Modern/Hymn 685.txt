HYMN 685

Rise at the cry of battle,
Arm for the coming strife,
By night and day you must fight
Til you pass through death to life.
Ready to face the danger,
Ready to right the wrong,
There is many a foe on the way you go,
Quit you like men, be strong!

Fiery and fierce the conflict,
Daring and swift the foe;
His hosts are found on the battle
ground,
Where they wait to lay you low;

Sharp are his darts and deadly,
Keen is the strife and long,
Then arm for the fight in the armor of light,
Quit you like men, be strong!

Strive til the strife is over,
Fight til the fight is won,
Though sore oppressed, seek not for rest
Until the day is done;
After the well-fought battle
Join in the victor’s Song,
Your trophies bring to CHRIST your King,
Quit you like men, be strong.
