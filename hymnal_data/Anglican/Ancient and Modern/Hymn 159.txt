HYMN 159

With hearts renewed and cleansed
from guilt of sin, Send we our voices pealing to the
skies;
Let a pure conscience each joy within And all our powers in emulation rise: To
FATHER, SON, and Holy SPIRIT’s
praise.
Three whom one essence joins,
one anthem here we raise.

Maker of all, the FATHER uncreate,
Of Him from everlasting born, the
SON,
And the Blest SPIRIT of co-equal state from both proceeding, are of substance One:
So in this Trinity the persons three One Perfect being are, One GOD,
One Majesty.

Yet, none the less, each PERSON of the Trine
GOD, in His attributes distinct, we
own;
Vainly would reason grasp the things Divine,
Man can but bend adoring at GOD’s
Throne:
O may the FATHER, SON, and SPIRIT
be
Our help in time of need, our joy
eternally.
