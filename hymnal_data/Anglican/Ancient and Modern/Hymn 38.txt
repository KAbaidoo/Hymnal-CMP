HYMN 38 EVENING

Blest creator of the light,
Making day with radiance bright,
Thou didst o’er the forming earth
Give the golden light its birth.

Shade of eve with morning ray
Took from Thee the name of day;
Darkness now is drawing nigh
Listen to our humble cry.

May we ne’er by guilt depress’d
Lose the way to endless rest:
Nor with idle thoughts and vain
Bind our souls to earth again.

Rather may we heavenward rise
Where eternal treasure lies;
Purified by grace within,
Hating every deed of sin.

Holy Father, hear our cry
Through Thy Son our Lord most high,
Whom our thankful hearts adore
With the Spirit evermore.
