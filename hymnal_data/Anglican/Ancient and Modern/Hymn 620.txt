HYMN 620 Apostles

In royal robes of splendor,
Before the great King’s feet,
The Princes of His Kingdom,
The crown’d Apostles, meet;
To Him their songs adoring
With heart and tongue they bring,
Pure hearts and mighty voices—
E’en as the Angels sing.

This Order sheds its luster
O’er all the human race;
A court of righteous judgment,
The Rock of Gospel grace;-
Rock of His Church, for ages
Elected and foreknown;
Whose glorious Master-Builder
Is Head and Corner-Stone.

These are the Nazareans,
Famed heralds to the world,
Who, preaching CHRIST, His Banner
Of victory unfurl’d,
Day unto day show knowledge;
Night utters speech to night;
So these to earth’s four corners
Their wondrous tale recite.

CHRIST’s burden light they proffer,
His easy yoke proclaim;
The seed of life they scatter,
That all may own His Name.
The earth brought forth and budded,
Where’er their ploughshare ran,
And fruits of increase followed
The faith of GOD made Man.

These are the sure foundation
On which the Temple stands;
The living stones compacting
The house not made with hands;
The gates by which man enters
Jerusalem the new;
The bond which knits together
The Gentile and the Jew.

Let error flee before them,
Let truth extend her sway;
Let dread of final judgment
To faith and love give way;
That, loosed from our offenses,
We then may numbered be
Among Thy Saints in glory,
Around the Throne with Thee.
