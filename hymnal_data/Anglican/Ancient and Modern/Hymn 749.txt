HYMN 749

Think, O LORD, in mercy
On the souls of those
Who, in faith gone from us, Now in death repose,
Here ‘mid stress and conflict Toils can never cease;
There, the warfare ended,
Bid them rest in peace.

Often were the wounded
In the deadly strife;
Heal them, good Physician,
With balm of life,

Every taint of evil,
Frailty and decay,
Good and gracious SAVIOUR,
Cleanse and purge away.

Rest eternal grant them,
After weary fight;
Shed on them the radiance
Of Thy heavenly light.
Lead them onward upward,
To the holy place,
Where Thy Saints made perfect Gaze upon Thy face.
