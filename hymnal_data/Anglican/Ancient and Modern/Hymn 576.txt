HYMN 576 Beginning of Term

LORD, behold us with Thy blessing Once again assembled here;
Onward be our footsteps pressing In Thy love, and faith, and fear; still protect us
By Thy presence ever near.

For Thy mercy we adore Thee,
For this rest upon our way;
LORD, again we bow before Thee,
Speed our labours day by day;
Mind and SPIRIT
With Thy choicest gifts array.

Keep the spell of home affection Still alive in every heart;
May its power, with mild direction, Draw our love from self apart,
Til Thy children
Feel that Thou their FATHER art.

Break temptation’s fatal power,
Shielding all with guardian care, Safe in every careless hour,
Safe from sloth and sensual snare; Thou, our SAVIOUR,
Still our failing strength repair.
