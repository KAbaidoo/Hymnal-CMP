Revive Thy work, O LORD,
Thy mighty arm make bare;
Speak with the voice that wakes the dead,
And make Thy people hear,
Revive Thy work, O LORD,
Disturb this sleep of death;
Quicken the smould’ring embers now
By Thine Almighty Breath.

Revive Thy work, O LORD,
Create soul-thirst for Thee:
And hungering for the Bread of Life
Oh may our spirits be.

Revive Thy work, O LORD,
Exalt Thy precious Name;
And by the Holy Ghost, our love
For Thee and thine inflame.

Revive Thy work, O LORD,
Give Pentecostal showers;
The glory shall be all thine own,
The blessing, LORD, be ours!
