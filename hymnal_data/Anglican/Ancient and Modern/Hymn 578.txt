HYMN 578 Holy Matrimony

O PERFECT love, all human thought 
transcending, Lowly we kneel in prayer before Thy 
Throne, 
That theirs may be the love which 
knows no ending, 
Whom Thou forevermore dost join 
in one. 

O perfect Life, be Thou their full 
assurance 
Of tender charity and steadfast faith Of patient hope, and quiet brave 
endurance, 
With childlike trust that fears nor 
pain nor death. 

Grant them the joy which brightens 
earthly sorrow, Grant them the peace which calms all earthly strife; And to life’s day the 
glorious 
unknown morrow 
That dawns upon eternal love and 
life.
