HYMN 5

My FATHER, for another night
Of quiet sleep and rest,
For all the joy of morning light,
Thy Holy Name be blest.

Now with the new-born day
I give Myself anew to Thee,
That as Thou willest I may live,
And what Thou willest be

Whate’er I do, things great or small,
Whate’er I speak or frame,
Thy glory may I seek in all,
Do all in JESUS’ Name.

My FATHER, for His sake, I pray,
Thy child accept and bless;
And lead me by Thy grace to-day
In paths of righteousness.
