HYMN 351

How welcome was the call,
And sweet the festal lay,
When JESUS deigned in Cana’s hall To bless the marriage day!

And happy was the Bride,
And glad the Bridegroom’s heart, For He who tarried at their side Bade grief and ill depart.

His gracious power divine
The water vessels knew;
And plenteous was the mystic wine The wondering servants drew.

O LORD of life and love,
Come Thou again today;
And bring a blessing from above That ne’er shall pass away,

O bless, as erst of old,
The bridegroom and the Bride;
Bless with the holier stream that flowed
Forth from Thy pierced side.

Before thine Altar-Throne
This mercy we implore; As Thou dost knit them, LORD, in one, So bless them evermore.
