HYMN 59

O come, all ye faithful,
Joyful and triumphant,
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem;
Come and behold Him

Born, the King of Angels,
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him, CHRIST
The LORD.

GOD of GOD,
Light of Light, Lo!
He abhors not the virgin’s Very GOD,
Begotten, not created;
O come, let us adore Him, etc,

Sing, choirs of Angels,
Singing exultation,
Sing, all ye citizens of Heav’n above;
“Glory to GOD In the highest;”
O come, let us adore Him. Etc.

Yea, LORD, we greet Thee,
Born this happy morning;
JESU, to Thee be glory given;
Word of the FATHER,

Now in flesh appearing;
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
CHRIST the LORD.
