HYMN 81

Song of soft thankfulness and praise,
JESUS, LORD, to Thee we raise
Manifested by the star
To the sages from afar;
Branch of royal David’s stem
In Thy Birth at Bethlehem;
Anthems be to Thee addrest,
GOD in Man made manifest.

Manifest at Jordan’s stream,
Prophet, Priest, and King supreme;
And at Cana wedding guest
In Thy GODhead manifest;
Manifest in power Divine,
Changing water into wine;
Anthems be to Thee addrest,
GOD in Man made manifest.

Manifest in making whole
Palsied limbs and fainting soul;
Manifest in valiant fight,
Quelling all the devil’s might;
Manifest in gracious will,
Ever bringing good from ill;
Anthems be to Thee addrest,
GOD in Man made manifest.

Sun and moon shall darken’d be,
Stars shall fall, the heavens shall flee;
CHRIST will then like lightning shine,
All will see his glorious sign;

All will then the trumpet hear,
All will see the Judge appear;
Thou by all wilt be confest,
GOD in Man made manifest.

Grant us grace to see the LORD,
Mirrored in Thy holy word;
May we imitate Thee now,
And be pure, as pure art Thou;
That we like to Thee may be
At Thy great Epiphany;
And may praise Thee, ever blest,
GOD in Man made manifest.
