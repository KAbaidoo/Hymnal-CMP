HYMN 561 Holy Baptism

With CHRIST we share a mystic
grave,
With CHRIST we buried lie;
But ‘tis not in the darksome cave By mournful Calvary.

The pure and bright baptismal flood Entombs our nature’s stain:
New creatures from the cleansing wave With CHRIST we rise again.

Thrice blest, if through this world of And sin, and selfish care, [strife, Our snow-white robe of righteousness We undefiled wear.

Thrice blest, if through the gate of All glorious and free [death We to our joyful rising pass,
O risen LORD, with Thee.
