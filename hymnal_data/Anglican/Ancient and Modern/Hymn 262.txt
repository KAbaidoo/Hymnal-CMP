HYMN 262

Great mover of all hearts, whose
hand
Do all the secret springs command Of human Thought and will, bless Thou, since the
world was made, dost Thy saints with fruits of holiness, Their order to fulfill.

Faith, hope, and love here weave
one chain;
But love alone shall then remain
When this short day is gone:
O love, O truth, O endless Light
When shall we see Thy Sabbath bright With all our labors done?

We sow ‘mid perils here and tears; There the glad hand the harvest
bears
Which here in grief hath sown:
Great THREE in ONE, the increase give; Thy gifts of grace, by which we live, With
heavenly glory crown.
