HYMN 637

Oh! come to the merciful SAVIOR
who calls you,
Oh! come to the LORD who forgives
and forgets;
Though dark be the fortune on earth
that befalls you, There’s a bright Home above, where
the sun never sets.

Oh! come then to JESUS, whose
Arms are extended To fold His dear children in closest
embrace;
Oh! come, for your exile will shortly
be ended,
And JESUS will show you His
beautiful Face.

Yes, come to the SAVIOR, whose
mercy grows brighter To longer you look at the depth of
His love;
And fear not! ‘tis JESUS! and life’s
cares grow lighter As you think of the Home and the
Glory above

Have sinned as none else in the
world have before you?
Are you blacker than all other
creatures in guilt?
Oh, fear not, and doubt not! the
mother who bore you Loves you less than the SAVIOR
Whose blood you have spilt!

Come, come to His feet, and lay
open your story
Of suffering and sorrow, of guilt and
of shame;
For the pardon of sin is the crown
of His glory,
And the joy of our LORD to be true
to His Name.
