HYMN 310

Lo! the Angels’ Food is given
To the pilgrim who hath striven;
See the children’s bread from heaven, Which on dogs may ne’er be spent;
Truth the ancient types fulfilling,
Isaac bound, a victim willing,
Paschal Lamb its life-blood spilling, Manna to the FATHER sent.

Very bread, good shepherd, tend us;
JESU, of Thy love befriend us;
Thou refresh us, Thou defend us,
Thine eternal goodness send us
In the land of life to see;
Thou who all things canst and knowest,
Who on earth such food bestowest,
Grant us with Thy saints, though lowest,
Where the heavenly feast Thou showest,
Fellow heirs and guests to be.
