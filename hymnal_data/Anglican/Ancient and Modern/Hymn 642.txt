HYMN 642 CHRISTmas 
 
 O Little town of Bethlehem, 
 How still we see Thee lie! 
 Above Thy deep and dreamless sleep The silent stars go by: 
 Yet in Thy dark streets shineth The everlasting Light - 
 The hopes and fears of all the years Are met in Thee tonight. 
  
 
 For CHRIST is born of Mary; 
 And, gathered all above, 
 While mortals sleep, the angels keep Their watch of wond’ring love, 
 O morning stars,
