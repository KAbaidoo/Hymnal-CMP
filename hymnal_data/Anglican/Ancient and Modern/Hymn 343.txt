HYMN 343

GOD eternal, mighty King,
Unto Thee our praise we bring;
All the earth doth worship Thee, We amid the throng would be.

Holy, Holy, Holy! cry
Angels round Thy Throne on high: LORD of all the heavenly powers, Be the same loud anthem ours.

Glorified Apostles raise
Night and day continual praise;
Hast not Thou a mission too
For Thy children here to do!

With the Prophets’ goodly line
We in mystic bond combine;
For Thou hast to babes revealed
Things that to the wise were sealed.

Martyrs, in a noble host
Of the cross are heard to boast; O that we our cross may bear,
And a crown of glory wear.

GOD eternal, mighty King,
Unto Thee our praise we bring;
To the FATHER, and the SON,
And the SPIRIT, THREE in ONE.
