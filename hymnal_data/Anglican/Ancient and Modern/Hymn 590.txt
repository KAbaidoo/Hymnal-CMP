HYMN 590 Jews

Unchanging GOD, hear from eternal
Heav’n:
We plead Thy gifts of grace, forever given,

Thy call, without repentance, calling still,
The sure election of Thy sovereign
will.

Put our faith in Thee, who canst
not lie,
Out of our heart’s desire, goes up our cry,
From hope’s sweet vision of the
thing to be,
From love to those who still are
loved by Thee.
