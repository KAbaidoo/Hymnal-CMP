HYMN 318

Bread of Heav’n, on Thee we feed,
For Thy flesh is meat indeed;
Ever may our souls be fed
With this true and living Bread;
Day by day with strength supplied
Through the life of Him Who died.

Vine of Heav’n, Thy Blood supplies
This blest Cup of Sacrifice;
LORD, Thy Wounds our healing give,
To Thy Cross we look and live;
JESUS, may we ever be
Grafted, rooted, built in Thee.
