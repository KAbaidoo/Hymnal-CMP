HYMN 269

"CHRISTIAN! seek not yet repose,"
Hear thy guardian Angel say;
Thou art in the midst of foes;
"Watch and pray."

Principalities and powers,
Mustering their unseen array,
Wait for Thy unguarded hours:
"Watch and pray."

Gird Thy heavenly armour on,
Wear it ever night and day;
Ambushed lies the evil one;
"Watch and pray."

Hear the victors who overcame;
Still they mark each warrior's way; All with one sweet voice exclaim, "Watch and pray."

Hear, above all, hear thy LORD,
Him Thou lovest to obey;
Hide within Thy heart his Word,
"Watch and pray."

Watch, as if on that alone
Hung the issue of the day;
Pray, that help may be sent down; "Watch and pray."
