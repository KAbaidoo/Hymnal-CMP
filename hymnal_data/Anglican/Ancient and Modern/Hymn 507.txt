HYMN 507 Whitsuntide

Bounteous SPIRIT, ever shedding Life the world to fill! Swarms the fruitful globe o’erspread - Shoals their ocean pathway thread - Own Thy quickening thrill; Author of each creature’s birth, Life of life beneath the earth, Everywhere, O SPIRIT blest, Thou art motion, Thou art rest.

Come, Creator! grace bestowing - All Thy sevenfold dower! Come, Thy peace and bounty strowing, Earth’s Renewer! thine the sowing, Thine the gladdening shower, Comforter! what joy Thou art To the blest and faithful heart; But to man’s primeval foe Uttermost despair and woe,

O’er the waters of creation Moved Thy Wings Divine; When the world, to animation Waking ‘neath Thy visitation, Tempted with powers benign: Thou didst man to being call, Didst restore him from his fall; Pouring, like the latter rain, Grace to quicken him again.

Thine the Gospel voices, crying As with trumpet sound, Till the world, in darkness lying, Rose from deathly sleep, descrying Heavenly light around. Man, to reach that prize revealed, Armed with Thee as with a shield, Nerved and … fight to win, Quelst the prince of death and sin.

Lowliest homage now before Thee Let the ransomed pay; For Thy wondrous gifts adore Thee, By Thy holiness implore Thee, While in love they pray: Holy! Holy! we repeat, Kneeling at Thy mercy-seat; There unbosom every woe, Groanings Thou alone canst know.

Fount of grace for every nation, Refuge of the soul! Strengthen Thou each new creation, With the waters of salvation Make the guilty whole: Rule on earth the powers that be; Give us priests inspired of Thee; Through Thy Holy Church increase Purest unity and peace.

Purge and sanctify us wholly From the leaven of ill; Save from Satan’s grasp unholy; To a living faith and lowly Mould the upright will; Till the olden zeal return, And with mutual love we burn; Till in peace, no more to roam, All the flock be gathered home.
