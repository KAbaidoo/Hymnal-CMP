HYMN 347 Confirmation

Come, HOLY GHOST, creator Blest,
Vouchsafe within our souls to rest;
Come with Thy grace and heavenly aid,
And fill the hearts which Thou hast made.

To Thee, the Comforter, we cry,
To Thee, the gifts of GOD most High,
The fount of life, the fire of love,
The soul’s Anointing from above.

O finger of the Hand Divine,
The sevenfold gifts of grace are thine;
True promise of the FATHER Thou,
Who dost the tongue with power endow.
Thy Light to every sense impart,
And shed Thy love in every heart,
Thine own unfailing might supply
To strengthen our infirmity.

Drive far away our ghostly foe,
And thine abiding peace bestow;
If Thou be our preventing Guide,
No evil can our steps betide.

Grant us through Thee, O Holy One,
To know the FATHER and the SON;
And this be our unchanging creed,
That Thou dost from them both proceed.
Praise we the FATHER, and the SON,
And Holy SPIRIT with them One:
And may the SON on us bestow
The gifts that from the SPIRIT flow.
