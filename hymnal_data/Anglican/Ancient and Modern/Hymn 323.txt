HYMN 323

I am not worthy, Holy LORD,
That Thou shouldst come to me;
Speak but the Word, one gracious Word Can set the sinner free,

I am not worthy; cold and bare
The lodging of my soul;
How canst Thou deign to enter there?
LORD, speak, and make me whole.

I am not worthy; yet my GOD
How can I say Thee nay;
Thee, Who didst give Thy Flesh and Blood
My ransom price to pay?

O come! In this sweet morning hour
Feed me with Food Divine;
And fill with all Thy love and power
This worthless heart of mine.
