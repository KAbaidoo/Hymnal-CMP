HYMN 454 FOR A DOCTOR

JESUS, for the beacon-light
By Thy holy Doctors given,
When the mists of error’s night
Gathered o’er the path to Heav’n;
For the witness that they bore
To the truth they learned of Thee,
For the glory that they share,
Let our praise accepted be.

In Jerusalem below
They were workmen at thy call,
Each with one hand met the foe,
With the other built the wall;
Watchmen on the mountain set,
Scribes instructed in Thy Word,
Fishers with the Gospel net
Drawing souls to Thee their LORD.

Like Thy learned Sons of yore,
JESU, may Thy Pastors still
Know and teach Thy sacred lore
With brave heart and patient skill,
In these later days of strife
Keep, O keep them true to Thee,
Till beside the well of life
Light in thine own Light they see.
