HYMN 657

PRAISE to the LORD, the Almighty,
the King of creation;
O my soul, praise Him, for He is Thy health and salvation; All ye who hear,
Now to His temple draw near,
Joining in glad adoration.

Praise to the LORD, who o’er all
things so wondrously reigneth, Shieldeth Thee gently from harm,
or when fainting sustaineth: Hast Thou not seen
How Thy heart’s wishes have been
Granted in what He ordaineth?

Praise to the LORD, Who doth prosper thy work and defend thee, Surely His goodness
and mercy
shall daily attend Thee; Ponder anew
What the Almighty can do,
If to the end He befriend Thee.
