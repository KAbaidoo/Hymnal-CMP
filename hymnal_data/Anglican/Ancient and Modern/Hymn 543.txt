HYMN 543

There’s peace and rest in Paradise, In weary hours we say;
And oh that we had wings like doves that we might flee away!

For here so strong the evil seems, So weak appears the good,
Our standard wavers in the rush Of evil, like a flood.

At times, through the long lonely watch,
Nor sun nor moon appear;
Without, incessant fightings are, Within, incessant fears.

Then for the quiet land we long, And the abode of peace;
And for the word, “Come, weary
From war and vigil cease!” [soul,

But in our stronger hours we grasp The warrior’s sword again,
And burn the good fight yet to fight, The faithful watch maintain,

We fain would tread the famous
Martyrs and saints have trod; [way The hours ebb fast of this one day Of noblest war for GOD!

The LORD Himself hath need of us; Oh! till the fight be won;
And the King’s words shall thrill the “Servant of GOD, well done!”
