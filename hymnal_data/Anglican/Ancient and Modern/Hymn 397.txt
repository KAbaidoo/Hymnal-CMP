HYMN 397

Lift the strain of high thanksgiving!
Tread with songs the hallowed way!
Praise our FATHER's GOD for mercies New to us their Sons today;
Here they built for Him a dwelling, Served Him here in ages past,
Fixed it for His sure possession, Holy ground, while time shall last.

When the years had wrought their changes,
He, our own changing GOD,
Thought on this His Habitation, Looked on His decayed abode;
Heard our prayers, and helped our counsels,
Blessed the silver and the gold, Till once more His House is standing Firm and stately as of old.

Entering then Thy gates with praise, LORD, be ours thine Israel's prayer; "Rise into Thy place of resting, Show Thy promised presence there!"
Let the gracious Word be spoken Here, as once on Zion's height, "This shall be my rest forever, This my dwelling of delight."

Fill this later house with glory Greater than the former knew;
Clothe with righteousness its Priesthood, Guide its choir to reverence true; Let Thy Holy One's anointing Here its sevenfold blessings shed; Spread for us the heavenly banquet, Satisfy Thy poor with bread.

Praise to Thee, Almighty FATHER, Praise to Thee, Eternal SON,
Praise to Thee al-quickening SPIRIT, Ever-blessed THREE in ONE;
Threefold Power and Grace and Wisdom,
Moulding out of sinful clay
Living stones for that true Temple Which shall never know decay.
