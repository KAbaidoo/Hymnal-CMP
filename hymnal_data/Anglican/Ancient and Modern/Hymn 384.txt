HYMN 384

To Thee, O LORD, our hearts we 
In hymns of adoration, raise 
To Thee bring sacrifice of praise 
With shouts of exultation; 
Bright robes of gold the fields adorn, The hills with joy are ringing, 
The valleys stand so thick with corn That even they are singing. 

And now, on this our festal day, 
Thy bounteous Hand confessing, 
Upon thine Altar, LORD, we lay 
The first-fruits of Thy blessing; 
By Thee the souls of men are fed 
With gifts of grace supernal, bread, Thou, who dost give us earthly 
Give us the Bread Eternal. 

We bear the burden of the day, 
And often toil seems dreary; 
But labour ends with sunset ray, 
And rest comes for the weary; 
May we, the Angel-reaping o'er, 
Stand at the last accepted, CHRIST’s golden sheaves for ever 
To garners bright elected. 

Oh, blessed is that land of GOD, 
Where Saints abide for ever; 
Where golden fields spread far and broad, 
Where flows the crystal river; 
The strains of all its holy throng 
With ours to-day are blending; 
Thrice blessed is that harvest-Song 
Which never hath an ending.
