HYMN 405 St. Paul

The Shepherd now was smitten;
The wolf was ravening near;
The scattered flock he threatened, But knew not whose they were.

In zealous fury seeking
A sudden voice withheld him,
A loud and startling cry;

“Saul! Saul! why blindly daring
To persecute Thy LORD?
‘Tis JESUS whom Thou hatest,
Rebel not at my word.”

Then forth in prayer he stretcheth Those hands prepared to slay;
“What wouldst Thou with Thy servant?
My LORD and Master, say.”

CHRIST’s foe becomes His soldier, The wolf destroys no more,
A gentle lamb he enters
The sheepfold by the door.

O voice of GOD Almighty,
What wonders hath it wrought!
It rends the lofty cedars,
It bends the haughty Thought.

JESU, our Shepherd, cease not
Thy flock from harm to free,
And, when Thy sheep are wandering, O lead them back to Thee.

To FATHER, SON, and SPIRIT
All glory, praise, and might,
Who called us out of darkness
To His own glorious light.
