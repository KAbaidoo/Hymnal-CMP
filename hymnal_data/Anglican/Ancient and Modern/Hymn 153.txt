HYMN 153

Joy! because the circling year
Brings our day of blessings here;
Day when first the light Divine
On the Church began to shine.

Like to quivering tongues of flame
Unto each the SPIRIT came,
Tongues that earth might hear their Fire, that love might burn in all.
So the wondrous works of GOD
Wondrously were spread abroad;
Every tribe’s familiar tone
Made the glorious marvel known,

Hardened scoffers vainly jeered;
Listening strangers heard and feared, Knew the prophet’s word fulfilled,
Owned the work which GOD had willed.

Still Thy SPIRIT’s fullness, LORD,
On Thy waiting Church be poured;
Grant our burdened hearts release;
Grant us thine abiding peace.
