HYMN 707 National Anthem 
 
 GOD save our gracious Queen Long live our noble Queen, GOD save the Queen 
 Send her victorious, 
 Happy and glorious, 
 Long to reign over us; 
 GOD save the Queen. 
  
 
 *O LORD our GOD, arise, 
 Scatter our enemies, 
 And make them fall; 
 Confound their politics, 
 Frustrate their knavish tricks; On Thee our hopes we fix; 
 GOD save us all. 
  
 
 Thy choicest gifts in store On her be pleased to pour, Long may she reign, 
 May she defend our laws, 
 And ever give us cause 
 To sing with heart and voice GOD save the Queen.
