HYMN 289

Days and moments quickly flying
Blend the living with the dead;
Soon will you and I be lying
Each within our narrow bed.

Soon our souls to GOD who gave them Will have sped their rapid flight: Able now by
grace to save them,
Oh, that while we can we might!

JESU, Infinite Redeemer,
Teach, O teach us to remember
What we are, and whence we came;

Whence we came, and whither wending;
Soon we must through darkness go, To inherit bliss unending,
Or eternity of woe.

O by Thy power grant, LORD, that we At our last hour fall not from Thee; Saved by
grace, thine may we be
All through the days of eternity.
