HYMN 2

O JESU, LORD of light and grace,
Thou Brightness of the FATHER’s Face.
Thou Fountain of eternal light,
True Day dispersing shades of night

Come, Very Sun of heavenly love,
Come in Thy radiance from above,
And shed the HOLY SPIRIT’s ray
On every Thought and sense to-day

So we the FATHER’s help will claim
And sing the FATHER’s glorious Name,
And His Almighty grace implore
That we may stand, to fall no more.

May He our actions deign to bless,
And quench the darts of wickedness;
In life’s rough ways our feet defend,
And grant us patience to the end

May faith, deep rooted in the soul,
Subdue our flesh, our minds control;
May guile depart and discord cease,
And all within be truth and peace.

So let us gladly pass the day,
Our Thoughts as pure as morning ray,
Our faith as noontide glowing bright,
Our minds undimmed by shades of night.

All praise to GOD the FATHER be,
All praise, Eternal SON, to Thee,
Whom with the SPIRIT we adore
For ever and for evermore.
