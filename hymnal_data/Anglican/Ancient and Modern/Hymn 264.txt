HYMN 264

My GOD, my FATHER, while I stray, Far from my home, on life’s rough way,
O teach me from my heart to say, “Thy will be done.”

Though dark my path, and sad my lot,
Let me be still and murmur not, Or breathe the prayer divinely taught, “Thy will be done.”

What Though in lonely grief I sigh For friends beloved no longer nigh, Submissive would I still reply, “Thy will be done.”
