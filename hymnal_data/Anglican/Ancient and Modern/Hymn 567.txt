HYMN 567

O my GOD, I fear Thee!
Thou art very high,
Yet to us, Thy children,
Thou art always nigh,
Far removed from mortal sight, Dwelling in eternal light.

O my GOD, I fear Thee!
Yet I come in prayer,
For my SAVIOUR tells me
I need not despair;
Tells me of a FATHER’s love, And a home prepared above,

Never earthly FATHER
Loveth like to Thee;
Thou dost guide and pardon
Guilty ones like me;
Sending down Thy Holy SON
That all sinners might be won.

O my GOD, I fear Thee,
Holy, just, and true;
But, my heavenly FATHER,
I will love Thee too;
Guide me till this life is past, Take me to Thyself at last.
