HYMN 7

CHRIST, Whose glory fills the skies, 
CHRIST, the true, the only Light, 
Sun of Righteousness, arise, 
Triumph o’er the shades of night; 
Day spring from on high, be near, 
Daystar, in my heart appear.

Dark and cheerless is the morn 
Unaccompanied by thee; 
Joyless is the day’s return, 
Till Thy mercy’s beams I see; 
Till thy inward light impart, 
Glad my eyes, and warm my heart.

Visit then this soul of mine, 
Pierce the gloom of sin and grief; 
Fill me, Radiancy Divine, 
Scatter all my unbelief; 
More and more Thyself display 
Shining to the perfect day.
