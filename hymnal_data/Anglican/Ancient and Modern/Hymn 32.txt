HYMN 32
AT THE END OF DIVINE SERVICE

And now the wants are told, that
Thy children to Thy knee;
Here lingering still,
we ask for nought,
But simply worship Thee.

The hope of Heav’n’s eternal days
Absorbs not all the heart
That gives Thee glory, love, and
For being what Thou art, praise,

For Thou art GOD, the One, the Same,
O’er all things high and bright;
And round us, when we speak Thy name,
There spreads a heav’n of light.

O wondrous peace, in Thought to
On excellence divine;
dwell To know that nought in man can tell
How fair Thy beauties shine!

O Thou, above all blessing blest,
O’er thanks exalted far,
Thy very greatness is a rest
To weaklings as we are;

For when we feel the praise of
Thee A task beyond our powers,
We say, ‘A perfect GOD is He,
And He is fully ours.”

All glory to the FATHER be,
All glory to the SON,
All glory, HOLY GHOST, to Thee
While endless ages run.
