HYMN 286

O let him, whose sorrow
No relief can find,
Trust GOD, and borrow
Ease for heart and mind.

Where the mourner weeping
Sheds the secret tear,
GOD His watch is keeping,
Though none else be near.

GOD will never leave Thee,
All Thy wants He knows,
Feels the pains that grieve Thee, Sees Thy cares and woes.

Raise thine eyes to Heav’n
When Thy spirits quail,
When, by tempests driven,
Heart and courage fail.

When grief we languish,
He will dry the tear,
Who His children’s anguish
Soothes with succor near.

All our woe and sadness,
In this world below,
Balance not the gladness
We in Heav’n shall know.

JESU, Holy SAVIOUR,
In the realms above
Crown us with Thy favour,
Fill us with Thy love.
