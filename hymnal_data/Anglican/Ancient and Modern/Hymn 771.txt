HYMN 771

My GOD! my GOD! and can it be
That I should sin so lightly now,
And think no more of evil thoughts
Than of the wind that waves the bough?

I sin, and heav’n and earth go
round,
As if no dreadful deed were done;
As if Thy Blood had never flowed
To hinder sin, or to atone.

I walk the earth with lightsome step
Smile at the sunshine, breathe the air,
Do my own will, nor ever heed
Gethsemane and Thy long prayer.

Shall it be always thus, O LORD?
Will Thou not work this hour in me
The grace Thy Passion merited,
Hatred of self, and love of Thee?

O by the pains of Thy pure love,
Grant me the gift of holy fear;
And by Thy woes and bloody sweat
Wash Thou my guilty conscience clear!

Ever when tempted make me see,
Beneath the olives’ moon-pierced shade,
My GOD, alone outstretched, and
And bleeding, on the earth He made;

And make me feel it was my sin,
As Thou no other sins were there,
That was to Him who bears the world
A load that He could scarcely bear.
