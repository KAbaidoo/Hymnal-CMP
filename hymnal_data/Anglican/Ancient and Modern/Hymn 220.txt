HYMN 220

JESUS shall reign where’er the sun
Doth his successive journeys run;
His kingdom stretch from shore to shore
Til moons shall wax and wane no more.

People and realms of every tongue
Dwell on His love with sweetest song,
And infant voices shall proclaim
Their early blessings on His Name.

Blessings abound where’er He reigns;
The prisoner leaps to lose his chains; The weary find eternal rest,
And all the sons of want are blest.

Let every creature rise and bring
Peculiar honors to our King;
Angels descend with songs again,
And earth repeat the loud Amen.
