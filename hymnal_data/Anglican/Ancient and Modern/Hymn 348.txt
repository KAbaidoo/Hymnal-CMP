HYMN 348

Behold us, LORD, before Thee met,
Whom each bright Angel serves and fears,
Yet Who on Thy Throne rememberest
Thy spotless Boyhood’s quiet years;
Whose feet the hills of Nazareth trod, Who art true Man and perfect GOD,

To Thee we look, in Thee confide,
Our help is in thine own dear name;
For who on JESUS e’er relied
And found not JESUS still the same?
Thus far Thy love our souls hath wrought.
O stablish well what Thou hast brought.

From Thee was our baptismal grace,
The holy seed by Thee was sown;
And now before our FATHER’s face
We make the three great vows our own,
And ask, in thine appointed way,
Confirm us in Thy grace today.

We need Thee more than tongue can speak,
‘Mid foes that well might cast us down;
But Thousands, once as young and weak,
Have fought the fight, and won the crown;
We ask the help that bore them through;
We trust the faithful and the true.

So bless us with the gifts complete
By hands of Thy chief Pastors given,
That awful presence kind and sweet
Which comes in sevenfold might from Heav’n;
Eternal CHRIST, to Thee we bow;
Give us Thy SPIRIT here and now.
