HYMN 492

Lo! now the time accepted peals
Its tidings of release;
A time that with salvation heals,
And to repentant tears reveals
The mercy-seat of peace.

Then let us wisely now restrain
Our food, our drink, our sleep;
From idle word and jest refrain,
And steadfastly begin again
A stricter watch to keep.

Now heaven-taught love will haste to rise
Where cold and wan the sufferer lies,
And CHRIST Himself to heedful eyes
Is hungering for bread.

'Tis now that zealous charity
Her goods more largely spends,
Lays up her treasure in the sky,
And makes us, blessed Trinity,
More faithful soldiers, worthier Thee,
Through this our chastening fast.

FOR A LATE EVENING
