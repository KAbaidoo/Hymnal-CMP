HYMN 185

LORD JESUS, think on me,
And purge away my sin;
From earth-born passions set me free, And make me pure within.

LORD JESUS, think on me,
With many a care oppressed;
Let me Thy loving servant be,
And taste Thy promised rest.

LORD JESUS, think on me,
Nor let me go astray;
Through darkness and perplexity
Point Thou the heavenly way.

LORD JESUS, think on me,
That, when the flood is past,
I may the eternal Brightness see,
And share Thy joy at last.

LORD JESUS, think on me,
That I may sing above
Praise to the FATHER, and to Thee,
And to the holy dove.
