HYMN 652 Ascensiontide

Hail, festal day, whose glory never
ends;
Now hell is vanquished, CHRIST to
heaven ascends.

All nature with new births of beauty
gay today.
Acknowledges her LORD’s return
Hail, festal day, &c.
Fair weather brings the flowers, and
earth is bright; From heaven’s open door streams
ampler light.
Hail, festal day, &c.

The greenwood trees, the fields in
blossoms swell
The joy of CHRIST’s return from that
dark hell.
Hail, festal day, &c.

CHRIST is gone up; no longer sin
shall reign;
Praise Him, blue sky, and sunlit sea
and plain.
Hail, festal day, &c.

Set free the captives of the pit below;
Call back again the things that
downward go.
Hail, festal day, &c.

Thy rescued are like sand beside the
sea,
And where their SAVIOUR goes, they
follow free.
Hail, festal day, &c.

Nurse in thine arms Thy people
cleanse from stain, [again.
And bear to GOD a gift made pure
Hail, festal day, &c.

One wreath receive for thine own
works on high,
Another for Thy people’s victory.
Hail, festal day, &c.

O SAVIOUR CHRIST, Thou art GOD’s
only Son,
Creator and Redeemer both in one.
Hail, festal day, &c.

As ancient as Thy FATHER and not less,
By Thee the world arose from
nothingness,
Hail, festal day, &c.

Thou, seeing all men crushed beneath
that ban, [man, Didst put on manhood to deliver
Hail, festal day, &c.
