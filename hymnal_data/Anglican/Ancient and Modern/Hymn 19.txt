HYMN 19

THE radiant morn hath passed away 
And spent too soon her golden store 
The shadows of departing day 
Creep on once more.

Our life is but a fading dawn 
Its glorious noon how quickly past; 
Lead us, O CHRIST, when all is gone, 
Safe home at last.

O by Thy soul-inspiring grace 
Uplift our hearts to realms on high; 
Help us to look to that bright place 
Beyond the sky;

Where light, and life, and joy and peace 
In undivided empire reign, 
And thronging Angels never cease 
Their deathless strain;

Where Saints are clothed in spotless 
White, And evening shadows never fall, 
Where Thou, Eternal Light of Light, 
Art LORD of all.
