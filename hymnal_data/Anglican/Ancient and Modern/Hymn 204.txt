HYMN 204

O quickly come, dread Judge of all;
For, awful Though thine advent be,
All shadows from the truth will fail, And falsehood die, in sight of Thee:
O quickly come: for doubt and fear
Like clouds dissolve when Thou art near.

O quickly come, great King of all;
Reign all around us, and within;
Let sin no more our souls enthrall,
Let pain and sorrow die with sin:
O quickly come: for Thou alone
Canst make Thy scattered people one.

O quickly come, true life of all;
For death is mighty all around;
On every home his shadows fall,
On every heart his mark is found:

O quickly come: for grief and pain
Can never cloud Thy glorious reign.
O quickly night broods o’er our
And weakly souls begin to fall away; With weary watching for the day;
O quickly come: for round Thy
Throne
No eye is blind, no night is known.
