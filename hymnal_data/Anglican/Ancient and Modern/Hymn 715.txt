HYMN 715

Here, O my LORD, I see Thee face to face;
Here would I touch and handle things unseen;
Here grasp with firmer hand th’ eternal grace,
And all my weariness upon Thee lean.

Here would I feed upon the Bread of GOD;
Here drink with Thee the royal Wine of heaven;
Here would I lay aside each earthly load;
Here taste afresh the calm of sin forgiven.

I have no help but thine; nor do I need
Another arm save thine to lean upon:
It is enough, my LORD, enough indeed;
My strength is in Thy might, Thy might alone.

Mine is the sin, but thine the righteousness;
Mine is the guilt, but thine the cleansing Blood;
Here is my robe, my refuge, and my peace,-
Thy Blood, Thy righteousness, O LORD my GOD.
