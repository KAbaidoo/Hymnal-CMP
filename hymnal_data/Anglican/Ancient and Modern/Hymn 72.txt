HYMN 72
NEW YEAR’S DAY

The year is gone, beyond recall,
With all its hopes and fears,
With all its bright and gladdening smiles,
With all its mourners’ tears;

Thy thankful people praise Thee, LORD,
For countless gifts received;
And pray for grace to keep the faith
Which saints of old believed.

To Thee we come, O gracious LORD,
The new-born year to bless;
Defend our land from pestilence;
Give peace and plenteousness;

Forgive this nation’s many sins;
The growth of vice restrain;
And help us all with sin to strive,
And crowns of life to gain.

From evil deeds that stain the
past We now desire to flee;
And pray that future years may all
Be spent, good LORD, for Thee.

O FATHER, let Thy watchful eye
Still look on us in love,
That we may praise Thee, year by
Year, with Angel-hosts above.

All glory to the FATHER be,
All glory to the SON,
All glory, HOLY GHOST, to Thee,
While endless ages run.
