HYMN 532

Church of the Living GOD,
Pillar and ground of truth,
keep the old paths the FATHERs trod In Thy illumined youth.

Lo! in Thy bosom lies
The touchstone for the age;
Seducing error shrinks and dies At light from yonder page.

Woe to the hands that dare,
By lust of power enticed,
To mingle with the doctrine there The frauds of AntiCHRIST.

Once to the saints was given
All blessed gospel lore; [Heav’n, There, written down in words from Thou hast it evermore.

Fear not, Though doubts abound, And scoffing tongues deride;
Love of GOD’s Word finds surer ground When to the utmost tried.

Toil at Thy sacred text;
More fruitful grows the field;
Each generation for the next Prepares a richer yield.

GOD’s Spirit in the Church
Still lives unspent, untired,
Inspiring hearts that fain would search
The truths Himself inspired.

Move, HOLY GHOST, with might
Amongst us as of old;
Dispel the falsehood, and unite In true faith the true fold.
