HYMN 729

As now Thy children lowly kneel
And all for mercy pray,
O FATHER, make us truly feel
The solemn words we say.

Teach us to hate the power of sin,
Which parts our souls from Thee;
Help us to make our life within
What Thou wilt love to see.

Teach us to trust the Lamb of GOD,
Who takes our sins away;
Help us to choose the path He trod,
And so Thy will obey.

Teach us to keep Thy holy laws
Because we trust Thy love;
Help us to rise, when JESUS draws
To better joys above.

O teach us more our sins to fear,
And more Thy word to love;
Help us on earth the cross to bear,
And win the crown above.
