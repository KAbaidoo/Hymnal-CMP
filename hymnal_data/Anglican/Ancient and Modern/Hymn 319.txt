HYMN 319 
 
 Author of life divine, 
 Who has a table spread, 
 Furnished with mystic wine 
 And everlasting bread, 
 Preserve the life Thyself has given, And feed and train us up for Heav'n 
 Our needy souls sustain 
 With fresh supplies of love, 
 Till all Thy life we gain, 
 And all Thy fullness prove, 
 And, strengthened by Thy perfect grace, 
 Behold without a veil Thy face.
