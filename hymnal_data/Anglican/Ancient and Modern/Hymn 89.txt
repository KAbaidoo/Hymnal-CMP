HYMN 89

Good it is to keep the fast
Shadowed forth in ages past,
Which our own Almighty LORD
Hallowed by His deed and word

Moses, while he fasted, saw
GOD who gave by him the Law;
To Elijah Angels came,
Steeds of fire and car of flame.

So was Daniel meet to gaze
On the sight of later days,
And the Baptist to proclaim
Name, Blessings through the Bridegroom's

Grant us, LORD, like them to be
Oft in prayer and fast with Thee
Fill us with Thy heavenly might,
Be our joy and true delight.

FATHER, hear us through Thy SON,
And the SPIRIT, with Thee One,
Whom our thankful hearts adore
Ever and for evermore.
