HYMN 659

The LORD is King! lift up Thy voice, O earth, and all ye heavens, rejoice; From world to 
world the joyful ring, 
“The LORD Omnipotent is King!”

The LORD is King! who then shall 
dare 
Resist His will, distrust His care, Or murmur at His wise decrees, 
Or doubt His royal promises?

The LORD is King! child of the dust The Judge of all the earth is just; Holy and true are 
all His ways: 
Let every creature speak His praise.

He reigns! ye saints, exalt your 
strains; Your GOD is King, your FATHER 
And He is at the FATHER’s side, 
The Man of love, the Crucified.

Come, make your wants, your burdens known; 
He will present them at the Throne; And angel bands are waiting there 
His messages of love to bear.

Alike pervaded by His eye 
All parts of His dominion lie;- 
This world of ours and worlds 
unseen, 
And thin the boundary between.

One LORD one empire all secures; 
He reigns, and life and death are 
yours; 
Through earth and heaven one Song 
shall ring, 
“The LORD Omnipotent is King!”
