HYMN 494: Passion

My LORD, my Master, at Thy feet
adoring, of woe; I see Thee bowed beneath Thy load
For me, a sinner, is Thy Life-Blood pouring;
For Thee, my SAVIOUR, scarce my
tears will flow.

Thine own disciple to the Jews has
sold Thee,
With friendship’s kiss and loyal word he came;
How oft of faithful love my lips have told Thee, and my same!
While Thou hast seen my falsehood

With taunts and scoffs they mock
what seems Thy weakness,
With blows and outrage adding pain
to pain;
Thou art unmoved and steadfast in
Thy meekness; I complain!
When I am wronged how quickly

My LORD, my SAVIOUR when I see
Thee wearing of thorn, Upon Thy bleeding brow the crown
Shall I for pleasure live, or shrink from bearing scorn?
Whate’er my lot may be of pain or

O victim of Thy love! O pangs most
healing! I adore!
O saving Death! O wounds that I
O shame most glorious! CHRIST,
before Thee kneeling
I pray Thee keep me thine for
evermore.
