HYMN 237

O GOD of hosts, the mighty LORD,
How lovely is the place, where Thou, enthroned in glory,
The brightness of Thy face!

My longing soul faints with desire
To view Thy blest abode;
My panting heart and flesh cry out
For Thee, the living GOD.

For in Thy courts one single day
'Tis better to attend,
Than, LORD, in any place besides
A Thousand days to spend.
O LORD of hosts, my King and GOD,
How highly blest are they
Who in Thy temple always dwell,
And there Thy praise display!

To FATHER, SON, and HOLY GHOST,
The GOD whom we adore,
Be glory, as it was, is now,
And shall be evermore.
