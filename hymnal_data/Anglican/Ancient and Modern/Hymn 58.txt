HYMN 58

GOD from on high hath heard;
Let sighs and sorrows cease;
Lo! from the opening Heav’n descends
To man the promised Peace.

Hark! Through the silent night
Angelic voices swell;
Their joyful songs proclaim that
Is born on earth to dwell.”

See how the shepherd-band
Speed on with eager feet;
Come to the hallowed cave with them
The Holy Babe to greet.

But, oh, what sight appears
With that lowly door! [clothes,
A manger, stall, and swaddling
A Child, and Mother poor!

Art Thou the CHRIST? The SON?
The FATHER’s image bright?

Yea, faith can pierce the cloud
Which veils Thy glory now;
Throne We hail Thee GOD, before whose
The Angels prostrate bow.

A silent Teacher, LORD,
Thou bidd’st us not refuse [shun,
To bear what flesh would have us
To shun what flesh would choose.

Our sinful pride to cure
With that pure love of thine,
O be Thou born within our hearts,
Most Holy Child Divine.
