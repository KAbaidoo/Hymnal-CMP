HYMN 151 Whitsun –Even 
 
 Ruler of the hosts of light, 
 Death hath yielded to Thy might; 
 and Thy Blood hath marked a road 
 which will lead us back to GOD. 
  
 
 From Thy dwelling-place above, 
 From Thy FATHER’s Throne of love, 
 With Thy look of mercy bless 
 Those without Thee comfortless. 
  
 
 Bitter were Thy throes on earth, 
 Giving to the Church her birth 
 From the spear-wound opening wide 
 In thine own life-giving side. 
  
 
 Now in glory Thou dost reign 
 Won by all Thy toil and pain; 
 Thence the promised SPIRIT send, 
 While our prayers to Thee ascend. 
  
 
 JESU, praise to Thee be given 
 with the FATHER high in heaven; 
 Holy SPIRIT, praise to Thee, 
 Now and through eternity.
