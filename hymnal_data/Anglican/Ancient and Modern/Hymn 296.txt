HYMN 296

Sing Alleluia forth in duteous praise, Ye citizens of heav’n; O sweetly raise An endless 
Alleluia.

Ye powers who stand before the 
Eternal light, In hymning choirs re-echo to the 
height 
An endless Alleluia.
The Holy City shall take up your 
strain, 
And with glad songs resounding 
wake again 
An endless Alleluia.
In blissful antiphons ye thus rejoice To render to the LORD with thankful 
voice 
An endless Alleluia.

Ye who have gained at length your 
palms in bliss, Victorious ones, your chant shall 
still be this, And endless Alleluia.
There, in one grand acclaim, forever 
ring 
The strains which tell the honour of 
your kind. 
An endless Alleluia.
This is sweet rest for weary ones 
brought back, This is glad food and drink which 
ne’er shall lack, And endless Alleluia.

While Thee, by whom ere all 
things made, we praise 
For ever, and tell out in sweetest 
lays 
An endless Alleluia.

Almighty CHRIST, to Thee our 
voices sing 
Glory for evermore: to Thee we 
bring 
An endless Alleluia.
