HYMN 283

O Thou, from whom all goodness
I lift my heart to Thee; In all my sorrows, conflicts, woes,
Good LORD, remember me.

When on my aching burdened heart
My sins lie heavily,
Thy pardon grant, Thy peace impart;
Good LORD, remember me.

When trials sore obstruct my way,
And ills I cannot flee,
Then let my strength be as my day,
Good LORD, remember me.

If worn with pain, disease, and grief
This feeble frame should be,
Grant patience, rest and kind relief;
Good LORD, remember me.

And, oh, when in the hour of death
I bow to Thy decree,
JESU, receive my parting breath;
Good LORD, remember me.
