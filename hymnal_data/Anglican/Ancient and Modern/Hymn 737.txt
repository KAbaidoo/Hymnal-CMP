HYMN 737 Church Workers

THE MASTER COMES! He calls for
Thee,-
Go forth at His Almighty word.
Obedient to His last command,
And tell to those who never heard,
Who sit in deepest shades of night,
That CHRIST has come to give them
light.

The Master calls! Arise and go;
How blest His messenger to be!
He, who hath given the liberty,
Now bids Thee set the captives free;
Proclaim His mighty power save
Who for the world His life-blood
gave.

The Master calls! Shall not thy heart
In warm responsive love reply,
“LORD, here am I; send me, send
me,-
Thy willing slave,-to live or die,-
An instrument unfit indeed,
Yet Thou wilt give me what I need?”

And if Thou canst not go, yet bring
An offering of a willing heart;
Then, though Thou tarriest at home,
Thy GOD shall give Thee too Thy
part;
The messengers of peace up……….
In ceaseless and prevailing prayer.

Short is the time for service true,
For soon shall dawn that glorious
Day
When, all the harvest gathered
Each faithful heart shall hear Him
say,- [o’er-
“My child, well done your toil is
Enter My joy forevermore”.
