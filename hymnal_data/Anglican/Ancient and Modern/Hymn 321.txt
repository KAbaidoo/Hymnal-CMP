HYMN 321

We pray Thee, heavenly FATHER, To hear us in Thy love,
And pour upon Thy children
The unction from above;
That so in love abiding,
From all defilement free,
We may in pureness offer
Our Eucharist to Thee.

Be Thou our Guide and Helper, O JESUS CHRIST, we pray;
So may we well approach Thee.
If Thou will be the Way:
Thou, very Truth, hast promised To help us in our strife,
Food of the weary pilgrim.
Eternal source of Life.

And Thou, Creator SPIRIT,
Look on us, we are Thine;
Renew in us Thy graces,
Upon our darkness shine;
That, with Thy benediction
Upon our souls outpoured
We may receive in gladness
The body of the LORD.

O Trinity of Persons!
O Unity most High!
On Thee alone relying
Thy servants would draw nigh: Unworthy in our weakness,
On Thee our hope is stayed
And blessed by Thy forgiveness We will not be afraid.
