HYMN 148

See the conqueror mounts in 
triumph, see the King in royal state Riding on the clouds His chariot 
to His heavenly palace gate; Hark! The choirs of Angel voices joy— 
ful Alleluias sing And the portals high are lifted to 
receive their Heavenly King.

Who is this that comes in glory, 
with the trump of jubilee? 
LORD of battles, GOD of armies, He 
has gained the victory; He who on the cross did suffer, He 
Who from the grave arose, He has vanquished sin and Satan, He 
He by death has spoiled His foes, 
While He lifts His Hands in blessing 
He is parted from His friends; While their eager eyes behold Him, 
He upon the clouds ascends; He who walked with GOD, and pleased 
Him, preaching truth and doom to come, 
He, our Enoch, is translated to His 
everlasting home.
Now our heavenly Aaron enters, 
With His Blood, within the veil; 
Joshua now is come to Canaan, and 
The Kings before Him quail; 
Now He plants the tribes of Israel 
In their promised resting-place; 
Now our great Elijah offers double 
Portion of His grace.

He has raised our human nature on 
The clouds to GOD’s right hand; 
There we sit in heavenly places, 
There with Him in glory stand: 
JESUS reigns, adored by Angels; 
Man with GOD is on the Throne; 
Mighty LORD, in Thine Ascension 
We by faith behold our own.
