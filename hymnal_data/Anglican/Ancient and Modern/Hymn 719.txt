HYMN 719

Be still, my soul! For GOD is near!
The great High Priest is with Thee now; The LORD of life Himself is near,
Before whose face the angels bow.

To make Thy heart His lowly Throne
Thy SAVIOUR GOD in love draws nigh;
He gives Himself unto His own,
For whom He once came down to die.

He pleads before the mercy seat;
He pleads with GOD; He pleads for
Thee: [to eat, He gives Thee bread from heav’n
His flesh and blood in mystery.

Come, O LORD! For Thou dost call
To blend my pleading prayer with thine; To Thee I give myself – my all,
And feed on Thee and make Thee mine.
