HYMN 250

Out of the deep I call
To Thee, O LORD, to Thee;
Before Thy Throne of grace I fall; Be merciful to me.

Out of the deep I cry,
The woeful deep of sin,
Of evil done in days gone by, Of evil now within.

Out of the deep of fear,
And dread of coming shame,
From morning watch till night is near I plead the Precious Name.

LORD, there is mercy now
As ever was, with Thee;
Before Thy Throne of grace I bow; Be merciful to me.
