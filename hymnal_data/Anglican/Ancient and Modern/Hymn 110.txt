HYMN 110

Go to dark Gethsemane,
Ye that feel the Tempter’s power
Your Redeemer’s conflict see
Watch with Him one bitter hour;
Turn not from His griefs away,
Learn of JESUS CHRIST to pray.

Follow to the judgment hall,
View the LORD of life arraigned
Oh, the wormwood and the gall!
Oh, the pangs His soul sustained!
Shun not suffering, shame, or loss;
Learn of Him to bear the cross.

Calvary’s mournful mountain climb;
There, adoring at His Feet,
Mark that miracle of time,
-GOD’s own Sacrifice complete;
“It is finished,” hear Him cry:
Learn of JESUS CHRIST to die.
