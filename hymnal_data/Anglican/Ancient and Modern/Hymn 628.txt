HYMN 628

Return, O wanderer, to Thy home, Thy FATHER calls for Thee;
No longer roam
in guilt and misery
Return, return!

Too long the loathsome fields of sin Thy fruitless toil have known:
No wholesome bread!
No home to call thine
Return, return!

Thy FATHER stands
with stretched hands,
He gave His SON for Thee
Poor soul, from sin’s enthralling bands He longs to set Thee free.
Return, return!

Arise, stand up and homeward turn, No longer dwell apart;
His mighty love will never spurn One humble contrite heart.
Return, return!

Our FATHER’s house is full of bliss And there is room for all:
He welcomes with forgiving kiss; O, hear His loving call!
Return, return!

The feast of joys awaits Thee there The precious robe and ring;
O haste Thy FATHER’s gifts to share, O haste His praise to sing:
Return, return!
