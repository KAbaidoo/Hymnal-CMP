HYMN 95
FOR A LATE EVENING SERVICE

O CHRIST, who art the light and
Day The beams chase night’s dark shades
The very light of light Thou art,

Who dost Thy blessed light impart,
All-Holy LORD, to Thee we bend,
Thy servants through this night defend,
And grant us calm repose in Thee,
A quiet night from perils free.

Let not the tempter round us creep
With thoughts of evil while we sleep,
Nor with his wiles the flesh allure
And make us in Thy sight impure.

While wearied eyes light slumber take,
The heart to Thee be still awake,
And Thy right hand stretched forth above
Protect the children of Thy love.

O LORD, our strong defense, be nigh;
Bid all the powers of darkness fly;
Preserve and watch o’er us for good,
Whom Thou hast purchased with Thy blood.

Remember us, dear LORD, we pray,
While burdened in the flesh we stay;
‘Tis Thou alone our souls canst keep
Abide with us this night in sleep.

Blest THREE in ONE, and One in Three,
Almighty GOD, we pray to Thee,
That Thou wouldst now vouchsafe to bless
Our fast with fruits of righteousness.
