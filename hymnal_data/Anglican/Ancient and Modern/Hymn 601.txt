HYMN 601
*THE GOD of Abraham praise
Who reigns enthroned above,
Ancient of everlasting days,
And GOD of Love: Jehovah, Great I AM,
By earth and Heav’n confessed;
We bow and bless the Sacred Name
Forever blest.

The GOD of Abraham praise
At Whose supreme command
From earth we rise, and seek the joys At His right Hand We alone earth forsake,
Its wisdom, fame, and power;
And Him our only Portion make,
Our Shield and Tower.

Though nature’s strength decay,
And earth and hell withstand,
To Canaan’s bounds we urge our way
At His command.
The watery deep we pass,
With JESUS in our view;
And through the howling wilderness
Our way pursue.

The goodly land we see,
With peace and plenty blest
A land of sacred liberty
And endless rest; There milk and honey flow,
And oil and wine abound,
And trees of life forever grow
With mercy crown’d.

There dwells the LORD, our King,
The LORD our Righteousness,
Triumphant o’er the world of sin,
The Prince of Peace: On Sion’s sacred height
His Kingdom He maintains,
And glorious with His saints in light Forever reigns.

*He keeps His own secure,
He guards them by His side,
Arraying a raiment white and pure
His spotless Bride: With streams of sacred bliss,
Beneath serener skies,
With all the fruits of Paradise,
He still supplies.

*Before the great Three-One
They exulting stand,
And tell the wonders He hath done
Through all their land: The listening spheres attend,
And swell the growing fame;
And sing, in songs which never end, The wondrous Name.

*The GOD Who reigns on high
The great Archangels sing;
And “Holy, Holy, Holy,” cry,
“Almighty King! Who was, and is the same.
