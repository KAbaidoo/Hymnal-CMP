HYMN 353

O Thou who makest souls to shine
With light from lighter worlds above,
And droppest glistening dew Divine
On all who seek a SAVIOR’s love;

Do Thou Thy benediction give
On all who teach, on all who learn
That so Thy Church may holier live,
And every lamp more brightly burn.

Give those who teach, pure hearts
and wise, by prayer; Faith, hope, and love, all warmed
Themselves first training for the skies, They best will raise their people there.

Give those who learn, the willing ear, The SPIRIT meek, the guileless mind;
Such gifts will make the lowliest here Far better than a kingdom find.

O bless the shepherd; bless the sheep; That guide and guided both be one,
One in the faithful watch they keep,
Until this hurrying life be done.
If thus, Good LORD, Thy grace be
given.
In Thee to live, in Thee to die,
Before we upward pass to Heav’n,
We taste our immortality.
