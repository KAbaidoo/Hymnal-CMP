HYMN 648 CROSS

O Word of pity, for our pardon 
pleading, 
Breathed in the hour of loneliness 
and pain; 
O voice, which through the ages 
interceding 
Calls us to fellowship with GOD

O word of comfort, through the 
silence stealing, As the dread act of sacrifice began; 
O infinite compassion, still revealing 
The infinite forgiveness won for man.

O word of hope to raise us nearer 
heaven, 
When courage fails us and when 
faith is dim; 
The souls for whom CHRIST prays to 
CHRIST are given, 
To find their pardon and their joy in Him.

O intercessor, who art ever living 
To plead for dying souls that they 
may live, 
Teach us to know our sin which 
needs forgiving, 
Teach us to know the love which can 
forgive.
