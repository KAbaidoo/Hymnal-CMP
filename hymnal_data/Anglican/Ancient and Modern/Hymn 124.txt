HYMN 124

Resting from His work today
In the tomb the SAVIOR lay;
Still He slept, from Head to Feet Shrouded in the winding-sheet,
Ling in the rock alone,
Hidden by the sealed stone.

Late at even there was seen
Watching long the Magdalene;
Early, ere the break of day,
Sorrowful she took her way
To the holy garden glade,
Where her buried LORD was laid.

So with Thee, till life shall end, I would solemn vigil spend;
Let me hew Thee, LORD, a shrine
In this rocky heart of mine,
Wherein pure embalmed cell
None but Thou may ever dwell.

Myrrh and spices will I bring,
True affection’s offering;
Close the door from sight and sound Of the busy world around;
And in patient watch remain
Till my LORD appear again.

EASTER
