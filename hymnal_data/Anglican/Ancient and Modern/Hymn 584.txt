HYMN 584 Working Men

Sons of Labour, dear to JESUS,
To your homes and work again;
Go with brave hearts back to duty, Face the peril, bear the pain.
Be your dwellings ne'er so lowly, Yet remember, by your bed,
That the SON of GOD most Holy
Had not where to lay His head.

Sons of Labour, think of JESUS
As you rest your homes within,
Think of that sweet Babe of Mary
In the stable of the Inn,
Think how in the sacred story
JESUS took a humble grade,
And the LORD of Life and Glory
Worked with Joseph at his trade.

Sons of Labour, pray to JESUS,
Oh, how JESUS prayed for you!
In the moonlight, on the mountain, Where the shimmering olives grew,
When you rise up at the dawning,
Ere to toil you wend your way,
Pray, as He prayed, in the morning, Long before the break of day.

Sons of Labour, be like JESUS,
Undefiled, chaste, and pure;
And, Thou Satan tempt you sorely
By His grace you shall endure.

Husband, FATHER, SON, and brother, Be ye gentle, just and true,-
Be ye kind to one another,
As the LORD is kind to you.

Sons of Labour, seek for JESUS,
Where He tells you yes shall find,
In the children, 'mid the mourners, In the sick, poor, lame, and blind,-
"Search the scriptures," He entreats you,
"For of Me they testify"; Love His Altar, where He meets
Saying, "Fear not – It is I."

Sons of Labour, go to JESUS,
In your sorrow, shame, and loss;
He is nearest, you are dearest,
When you bravely bear His Cross.
Go to Him, who died to save you,
And is still the sinner's Friend;
And the great love, which forgave
Will forgive you to the end.

Sons of Labour, live for JESUS,
Be your work your worship too;
In His Name, and to His glory,
Do whatever you find to do,
Till this night of sin and sorrow
Be forever overpast;
And we see the golden morrow,
Home with JESUS, home at last!
