HYMN 725 Holy Baptism 
 
 Grant to this child the inward grace, 
 While we the outward sign impart; 
 The cross we on his forehead trace 
 Do Thou engrave upon his heart. 
  
 May it his pride and glory be, 
 Beneath Thy banner fair unfurled, 
 To march to certain victory 
 O’er sin, o’er Satan, o’er the world.
