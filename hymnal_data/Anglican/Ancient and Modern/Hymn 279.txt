HYMN 279

O Help us, LORD; each hour of need Thy heavenly succor give; Help us in
Thought, and word, and
Each hour on earth we live.

O help us, when our SPIRITS bleed
With contrite anguish sore; And when our hearts are cold and
O help us, LORD, the more.

O help us, through the prayer of
More firmly to believe
For still the more the servant hath, The more shall he
receive.

O help us, JESU, from on high,
We know no help but Thee;
O help us so to live and die
As thine in heav’n to be.
