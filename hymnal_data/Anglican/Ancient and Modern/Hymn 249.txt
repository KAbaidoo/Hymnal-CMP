HYMN 249

Have mercy, LORD, on me,
As Thou wert ever kind;
Let me, oppressed with loads of guilt, Thy wonted mercy find.

Wash off my foul offense,
And cleanse me from my sin;
For I confess my crime, and see How great my guilt has been.

The joy Thy favor gives
Let me again obtain,
And Thy free SPIRIT’s firm support My fainting soul sustain.

To GOD the FATHER, SON,
And SPIRIT glory be,
As ‘twas, and is, and shall be so To all eternity.
