HYMN 702

A Charge to keep I have,
A GOD to glorify
A never-dying soul to save
And fit it for the sky

To serve the present age,
My calling fulfill;
Oh, may it all my powers engage To do my Master’s will.

Arm me with jealous care,
As in Thy sight to live;
And oh, Thy servant, LORD, prepare, A good account to give.

Help me to watch and pray,
And on Thyself rely;
And let me ne’er my trust betray, But press to realms on high.
