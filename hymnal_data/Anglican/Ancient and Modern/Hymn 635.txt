HYMN 635

Weary of wandering from my GOD,
And now made willing to return,
I hear, and bow me to the rod;
For Thee, not without hope, I mourn;
I have an Advocate above,
A friend before the Throne of love.

O JESUS, full of pardoning grace,
More full of grace than I of sin.
Yet once again I seek Thy face;
Open thine Arms, and take me in,
And freely my backslidings heal,
And love the faithless sinner still.

Thou know’st the way to bring my
fallen SPIRIT to restore; [back
O for Thy truth and mercy’s sake
Forgive, and bid me sin no more;
The ruins of my soul repair,
And make my heart a house of prayer.

The stone to flesh again convert,
The veil of sin once more remove
Sprinkle Thy blood upon my heart
And melt it with Thy dying love
This rebel heart by love subdue
And make it soft, and make it new.

Ah, give me, LORD, the tender heart
That trembles at the approach of sin
A GODly fear of sin impart,
Implant, and root it deep within
That I may dread Thy gracious power
And never dare offend Thee more.
