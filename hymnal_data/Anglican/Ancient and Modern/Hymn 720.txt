HYMN 720

With solemn faith we offer up
And spread, O GOD, before thine eyes
That only ground of all our hope,
That precious, once-made sacrifice,
Which brings Thy grace on sinners
down,
And perfects all our souls in one.

Acceptance through His only Name,
Forgiveness in His Blood we have;
But more abundant life we claim
Through Him who died our souls to
save,
To sanctify us by His Blood
And fill with all the life of GOD.

As it were slain behold Thy SON,
And hear His blood that speaks
above;
On us let all Thy grace be shown.
Peace, righteousness, and joy, and
love;
Thy kingdom come to every heart,
And all Thou hast, and all Thou art.
