HYMN 599 For a Bible Class

Come, HOLY GHOST, our hearts
inspire,
Let us Thy influence prove;
Source of the old prophetic fire,
Fountain of life and love.

Come, HOLY GHOST, for moved by
Thee
The prophets wrote and spoke;
Unlock the Truth, Thyself the Key,
Unseal the Sacred Book.

GOD through Himself we then shall
know
If Thou within us shine,
And sound, with all Thy saints
The depths of Love Divine.
