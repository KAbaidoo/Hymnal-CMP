HYMN 423

Stars of the morning, so gloriously bright,
Filled with celestial virtue and light, These that, where night never followeth day,
Raise the “Trisagion” ever and aye;

These are Thy ministers, these dost Thou own,
LORD GOD of Sabaoth, nearest Thy Throne;
These are Thy messengers, these dost Thou send,
Help of the helpless ones! man to defend.

* In Greek, from which this Hymn is translated, “Trisagion” is the same as the Latin “Tersanctus” and the English “Thrice-Holy.

These keep the guard amidst Salem’s dear bowers,
Thrones, Principalities, virtues, and powers,
Where, with the Living Ones, mystical four,
Cherubim, Seraphim bow and adore, Then, when the earth was first poised in mid space,
Then, when the planets first sped on their race,
Then when were ended the six days’ employ
Then all the Sons of God shouted for joy,
Still let them succor us; still let them fight,
LORD of Angelic hosts, battling for right;
Till, where their anthems they ceaselessly pour,
We with the Angels may bow and adore.
