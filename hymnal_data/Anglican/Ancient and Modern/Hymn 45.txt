HYMN 45 
 Advent 
 
 Creator of the starry height, 
 Thy people’s everlasting Light, 
 JESU, Redeemer of us all, 
 Hear Thou Thy servants when they call. 
  
 
 Thou, sorrowing at the helpless cry 
 Of all creation doomed to die, 
 Did save our lost and guilty race 
 By healing gifts of heavenly grace. 
  
 
 When earth was near its evening hour, 
 Thou didst, in love’s redeeming power, 
 Like bridegroom from his chamber, 
 come forth from a virgin-mother’s womb. 
  
 
 At Thy great name, exalted now, 
 All knees in lowly homage bow; 
 All things in heaven and earth adore, 
 And Thee King of evermore. 
  
 
 To Thee, O Holy One, we pray, 
 Our Judge in that tremendous day, 
 Ward off, while yet we dwell below, 
 The weapons of our crafty foe. 
  
 
 To GOD the FATHER, GOD the SON, 
 And GOD the SPIRIT, THREE in ONE, 
 Praise, honour, might, and glory be 
 From age to age eternally.
