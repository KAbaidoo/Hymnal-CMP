HYMN 449 FOR THE B. V. MARY

The GOD, whom earth, and sea, and 
Adore, and laud, and magnify 
Whose might they own, whose 
Praise themselves, 
In Mary’s womb vouchsafed to dwell.

The LORD, whom sun and moon 
obey, Whom all things serve from day to 
Was by the HOLY GHOST conceived 
Of her who through His grace believed.

How blest that Mother, in whose 
shrine 
The world’s Creator, LORD Divine, 
Whose Hand contains the earth and 
sky, 
Once deigned, as in His ark, to lie; 
Blessed in the message Gabriel brought, Blessed by the work the SPIRIT wrought; From 
whom the great Desire of earth Took human flesh and human birth.

O LORD, the Virgin-born, to Thee 
Eternal praise and glory be, 
Whom with the FATHER we adore 
And HOLY GHOST forevermore.
