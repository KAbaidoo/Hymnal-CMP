HYMN 582

Thou, who didst call Thy saints of Thy chosen flock to teach, Who mad’st the 
fearful-hearted bold, And quick the slow of speech; 
Still Thou dost ask whom thus halt And who will go for Thee, To feed Thy lambs, 
Thy sheep to tend; 

O send us – e’en as Thou, O LORD, Wast by the FATHER sent— 
To speak thine own absolving word To sinners penitent; 
To wash Thy chosen in the flood 
Whereby new birth is given; 
To minister the sacred Food, 
The Bread of Life from Heav’n. 

And Thou, who didst by prophets 
To speak the will divine, deign That we may never speak in vain 
May all our words be thine; 
Oh, teach us, HOLY GHOST, that we Thine heritage may teach;- 
Bid us to prophesy for Thee, 
And in Thy power to preach. 

So may we, Though unworthy still, Most Holy Trinity, 
Thy prophet, pastors, priest, fulfill Our sacred ministry: 
That, when beside the crystal sea We lay our office down, The souls that we have 
trained for Thee May be our joy and crown.
