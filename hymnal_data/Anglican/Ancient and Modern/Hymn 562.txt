HYMN 562

O FATHER, bless the children
Brought hither to Thy gate;
Lift up their fallen nature,
Restore their lost estate;
Renew thine image in them,
And own them, by this sign,
Thy very Sons and daughters,
New born of birth Divine.

O JESUS LORD, receive them;
Thy loving Arms of old
Were opened wide to welcome
The children to Thy fold;
Let these, baptized, and dying,
Then rising from the dead,
Henceforth be living members
Of Thee, their living Head.

O Holy SPIRIT, keep them;
Dwell with them to the last,
Till all the fight is ended,
And all the storms are past
Renew the gift baptismal,
From strength to strength, till each
The troublous waves overcoming,
The land of life shall reach.

O FATHER, SON, and SPIRIT,
O Wisdom, Love, and Power,
We wait the promised blessing
In this accepted hour!
We name upon the children
The threefold Name Divine;
Receive them, cleanse them, own them,
And keep them ever thine.
