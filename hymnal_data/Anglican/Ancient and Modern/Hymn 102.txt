HYMN 102

He, who once in righteous vengeance
Whelmed the world beneath the flood
Once again in mercy cleanse it
With his own most precious blood,
Coming from His Throne on high
On the painful cross to die.

O the wisdom of the Eternal!
O the depth of love Divine!
O the sweetness of that mercy
Which in JESUS CHRIST did shine!
We were sinners doomed to die;
JESUS paid the penalty.

When before the Judge we tremble,
Conscious of His broken laws,
May the blood of His atonement
Cry aloud, and plead our cause,
Bid our guilty terrors cease,
Be our pardon and our peace.

Prince and Author of salvation,
LORD of Majesty supreme,
JESUS, praise to Thee be given
By the world Thou didst redeem;
Glory to the FATHER be
And the SPIRIT One with Thee.
