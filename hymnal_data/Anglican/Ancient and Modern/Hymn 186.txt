HYMN 186

I could not do without Thee,
O SAVIOR of the lost,
Whose precious blood redeemed me At such tremendous cost;
Thy righteousness, Thy pardon,
Thy precious blood must be
My only hope and comfort
My glory and my plea.

I could not do without Thee,
For, oh, the way is long,
And I am often weary,
And sigh replaces song;
How could I do without Thee?
I do not know the way;
Thou knowest and Thou leadest,
And wilt not let me stray.

I could not do without Thee,
O JESUS, SAVIOR dear;
Even when my eyes are holden,
I know that Thou art near;
How dreary and how lonely
This changeful life would be
Without the sweet communion,
The secret rest with Thee.

I could not do without Thee;
No other friend can read
The SPIRIT’s strange deep longings, Interpreting its need;
No human heart could enter
Each dim recess of mine,
And soothe, and hush, and calm it, O Blessed LORD, but thine.

I could not do without Thee.
For years are fleeting fast,
And soon in solemn loneliness
The river must be passed;
But Thou wilt never leave me,
And though the waves roll high,
I know Thou wilt be near me,
And whisper, ‘It is I.’
