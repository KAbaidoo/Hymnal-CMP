HYMN 560 FOR CHURCH-WORKERS

With weary feet and saddened heart, From toil and care we flee,
And come, O dearest LORD, apart To rest awhile with Thee.

The courts of Heav’n were lost till the world had come between;
But here the veil is rent in two; We see the things unseen.

Our sins, in Thy pure light descried, Stand out in dread array;
But here in Love’s absolving tide Their guilt washed away.

With strife of tongues distraught and worn
Our troublous way we trod;
But cast ourselves, this holy morn, Into the peace of GOD.

And oh! what depth of joy, as thus We bend the trembling knee,
To know that Thou art one with us, And we are one with Thee.
