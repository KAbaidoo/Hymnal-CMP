HYMN 371

Almighty FATHER, hear our cry,
As o’er the trackless deep we roam; Be Thou our haven always nigh,
On homeless waters Thou our home.

O JESUS, SAVIOR, at Whose Voice
The tempest sank to perfect rest, Bid Thou the fearful heart rejoice, And cleanse and calm
the troubled breast.
O HOLY GHOST, beneath Whose
Power,
The ocean woke to life and light, Command Thy blessing in this hour, Thy fostering
warmth, Thy quickening might.

Great GOD of our salvation, Thee
We love, we worship, we adore;
Our Refuge on time’s changeful sea, Our Joy on Heav’n’s eternal shore.
