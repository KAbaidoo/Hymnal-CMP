HYMN 417

“Thou art the CHRIST, O LORD,
The SON of GOD most high!”
Forever be adored
That Name in earth and sky,
In which, Though mortal strength may fail,
The saints of GOD at last prevail!

Oh, surely he was blest
With blessedness unpriced,
Who, taught of GOD, confessed
The GODhead in the CHRIST!
For of the Church, LORD, Thou
didst own
Thy saint a true foundation-stone.

Thrice was he put to shame,
Thrice did the dauntless fail;
But, oh, that look that came
From out the judgment-hall!
It pierced and broke the spell-bound heart,
And foiled the tempter’s sifting art.

Thrice fallen, thrice restored!
The bitter lesson learnt,
That heart for Thee, O LORD,
With triple ardor burnt,
The cross he took he laid not down
Until he grasped the Martyr’s crown.

Oh, bright triumphant faith!
Oh, courage void of fears!
Oh, love most strong in death!
Oh, penitential tears!
By these, LORD, keep us lest we fail,
And make us go where Thou shalt call.
St. James the Apostle
