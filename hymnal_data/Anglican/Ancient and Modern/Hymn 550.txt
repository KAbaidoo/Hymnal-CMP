HYMN 550

Angel-Voices, ever singing,
Round Thy Throne of light,
Angel-harps forever ringing,
Rest not day nor night;
Thousands, only live to bless Thee And confess Thee LORD of might!

Thou, who art beyond the farthest
Mortal eye can scan, -
Can it be that Thou regardest
songs of sinful man?
Can we know that Thou art near us, And wilt hear us?
Yea, we can!

Yea, we know that Thou rejoices
O’er each work of thine;
Thou didst ears and hands and
For Thy praise design: [voices Craftsman’s art and music’s measure For Thy pleasure
All combine.

In Thy house, Great GOD, we offer Of thine own to Thee;
And for thine acceptance proffer
All unworthily
Hearts and minds and hands and
In our choices [voices, Psalmody.

Honour, glory, might, and merit
Thine shall ever be,
FATHER, SON, and Holy SPIRIT,
Blessed Trinity!
Of the best that Thou hast given, Earth and Heaven Render Thee
