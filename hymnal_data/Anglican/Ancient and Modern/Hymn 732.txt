HYMN 732 FOR LITTLE CHILDREN

Our GOD of Love, who reigns above, Comes down to us below;
'Tis sweet to tell He loves so well, And 'tis enough to know.

So deep, so high – like air and sky, Beyond us, yet around;
He Whom our mind can never find, Can in our heart be found.

LORD GOD, so far, past sun and star, Yet close to all our ways!
In love so near, be pleased to hear Thy little children’s praise!

O may that sign that we are thine - Our FATHER, SAVIOUR, Friend—
Which sealed our brow, be on us now, And with us to the end.

Through all our way, and every day Believed, beloved, adored;
Be this our grace to see Thy face In JESUS CHRIST our LORD.
