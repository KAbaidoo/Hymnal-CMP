HYMN 282

Be Thou my guardian and my guide, And hear me when I call;
Let not my slippery footsteps slide, And hold me lest I fall.

The world, the flesh, and Satan dwell Around the path I tread;
O save me from the snares of hell, Thou quickener of the dead.

And if I'm tempted to sin,
And outward things are strong,
Do Thou, O LORD, keep watch within, And save my soul from wrong.

Still let me ever watch and pray, And feel that I am frail;
That if the tempter cross my way, Yet he may not prevail.
