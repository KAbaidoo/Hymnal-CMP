HYMN 104

O sinner, lift thee up of faith,
To true repentance turning;
Be think Thee of the curse of sin,
Its awful guilt discerning;
Upon the crucified one look,
And Thou shalt read, as in a book,
What well is worth Thy learning.

Look on His head, that bleeding Head,
With crown of thorns surrounded;
Look on His sacred Hands and feet
Which piercing nails have wounded;
See every limb with scourges rent:
On Him, the just, the Innocent,
What malice hath abounded!

‘Tis not alone those limbs are racked,
But friends too are forsaking;
And, more than all, for thankless man,
That tender heart is aching;
Oh, fearful was the pain and scorn,
By JESUS, SON of Mary, borne,
Their peace for sinner making.

None ever knew such pain before,
Such infinite affliction,
None ever felt a grief like His
In that dread crucifixion;
For us He bore those bitter throes,
For us those agonizing woes,
In oft-renewed infliction.

Sinner, mark, and ponder well
Sin’s awful condemnation;
Think what a sacrifice it cost
To purchase Thy salvation;
Had JESUS never bled and died
Then what could Thee and all be tied
But uttermost damnation?

LORD, give us grace to flee from sin,
And Satan’s wiles ensnaring,
And from those everlasting flames
For evil ones preparing.
JESU, we thank Thee, and entreat
To rest forever at Thy feet,
Thy heavenly glory sharing.
