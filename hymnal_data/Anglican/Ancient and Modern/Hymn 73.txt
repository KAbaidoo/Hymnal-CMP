HYMN 73

For Thy mercy and Thy grace,
Faithful through another year,
Hear our Song of thankfulness;
JESUS, our redeemer, hear.

In our weakness and distress,
Rock of strength, be Thou our stay;
In the pathless wilderness
Be our true and living way.

Who of us death’s awful road
In the coming year shall tread,
With Thy rod and staff, O GOD,
Comfort Thou his dying bed.

Keep us faithful, keep us pure,
Keep us evermore thine own,
Help, O help us to endure,
Fit us for Thy promised crown.

So within Thy palace gate
We shall praise, on golden strings,
Thee the only potentate,
LORD of LORDS and King of kings.
