HYMN 511

Glorious is Thy Name, O LORD!
Heav'n and earth with one accord
Tell Thy greatness, part revealed,
But the larger part concealed.
How shall we poor sinners dare
Seek Thy face in praise and prayer?

Fearful is Thy Name, O LORD!
Dread Thy voice, and sharp Thy sword;
Thunders roll around Thy path;
None can stand before Thy wrath!
How shall trembling sinners dare
Lift their voice in praise and prayer?

Yet with all Thy wondrous might
Far beyond our mortal sight,
Perfect wisdom, boundless powers,
Thou, O glorious GOD! art ours.
So, Though filled with awe, we dare, Name Thy Name in praise and prayer.

Since, to save a world undone,
Thou didst give thine only SON,
All Thy greatness, LORD Most High,
Brings Thee to our hearts more nigh.
Thus in faith and hope we dare
Claim Thy love in praise and prayer.
