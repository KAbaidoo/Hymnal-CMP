HYMN 218

GOD of mercy, GOD of grace,
Show the brightness of Thy face; Shine upon us, SAVIOUR, shine,
Fill Thy Church with light Divine; And Thy saving health extend
Unto earth’s remotest end.

Let the people praise Thee, LORD; By all that live adored:
Let the nations shout and sing
Glory to their SAVIOUR King;
At Thy feet their tribute pay
And Thy holy will obey.

Let the people praise Thee, LORD, Earth shall then her fruits afford; GOD to man His
blessing give,
Man to GOD devoted Live;
All below, and all above,
One in joy, and light, and love.
