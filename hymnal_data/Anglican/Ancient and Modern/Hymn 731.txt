HYMN 731 Sunday

Again the morn of gladness,
The morn of light, is here;
And earth itself looks fairer,
And heaven itself more near.
The bells, like angels' voices,
Speak peace to every breast,
And all the land lies quiet
To keep the day of rest.
Glory be to JESUS,
Let all His children say;
He rose again, He rose again,
On this glad day.

Again, O loving SAVIOUR,
The children of Thy grace
Prepare themselves to seek Thee
Within Thy chosen place.
Our song shall rise to greet Thee,
If Thou our hearts wilt raise;
If Thou our lips wilt open,
Our mouths shall show Thy praise,
Glory be to JESUS, &c.

The shining choir of angels
That rest not day nor night,
The crown'd and palm-deck'd martyrs,
The saints array'd in white,
The happy lambs of JESUS
In pastures fair above,
These all adore and praise Him,
Whom we, too, praise and love,
Glory be to JESUS, &c.

The Church on earth rejoices
To join with these to-day;
In every tongue and nation
She calls her Sons to pray.
Across the northern snow-fields,
Beneath the Indian palms,
She makes the same pure offering,
And sings the same sweet psalms,
Glory be to JESUS, &c.

Tell out, sweet bells, His praises!
Sing, children, sing His Name!
Still louder and still further
His mighty deeds proclaim!
Till all whom He redeemed
Shall own Him LORD and King;
Till every knee shall worship,
And every tongue shall sing
Glory be to JESUS, &c.
