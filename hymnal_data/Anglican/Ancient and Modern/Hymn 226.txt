HYMN 226

The world is very evil,
The times are waxing late,
Be sober and keep vigil,
The judge is at the gate;
The judge who comes in mercy,
The Judge who comes with might, Who comes to end the evil,
Who comes to crown the right.

Arise, arise, good Christian,
Let right to wrong succeed;
Let penitential sorrow
To heavenly gladness lead,
To light that has no evening,
That knows no moon nor sun,
The light so new and golden,
The light that is but one.

O home of fadeless splendor,
Of flowers that bear no thorn,
Where they shall dwell as children Who here as exiles mourn;

'Midst power that knows no limit, Where wisdom has no bound,
The beatific vision
Shall glad the Saints around.

O happy, holy portion,
Refection for the blest,
True vision of true beauty,
True cure of the distressed!
Strive, man, to win that glory; Toil, man, to gain that light;
Send hope before to grasp it,
Till hope be lost in sight.

O sweet and blessed country,
The home of God's elect!
O sweet and blessed country
That eager hearts expect!
Jesus in mercy bring us
To that dear land of rest;
Who art, with God the Father
And Spirit, ever blest.
