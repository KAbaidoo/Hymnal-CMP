HYMN 273

O LORD, how joyful 'tis to see
The brethren join in love to Thee!
On Thee alone their heart relies,
Their only strength Thy grace
supplies.

How sweet within Thy holy place
With one accord to sing Thy grace,
Besieging Thine attentive ear
With all the force of fervent prayer!

O may we love the House of GOD,
Of peace and joy the blest abode:
O may no angry strife destroy
That sacred peace, that holy joy.

The world without may rage, but we
Will only cling more close to Thee,
With hearts to Thee more wholly
given, on heav'n.
More wean'd from earth, more fix'd

LORD, shower upon us from above
The sacred gift of mutual love;
Each other's wants may we supply,
And reign together in the sky.

Praise GOD, from whom all blessings
flow,
Praise Him, all creatures here below,
Praise Him above, Angelic host,
Praise FATHER, SON, and Holy
Ghost.
