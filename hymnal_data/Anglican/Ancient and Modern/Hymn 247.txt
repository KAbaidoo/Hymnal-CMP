HYMN 247

LORD, teach us how to pray aright With reverence and with fear;
Though dust and ashes in Thy sight, We may, we must draw near.

We perish, we cease from prayer;
O grant us power to pray;
And, when to meet Thee we prepare, LORD, meet us by the way.

GOD of all grace, we bring to Thee A broken contrite heart;
Give, what Thine eye delights to see, Truth in the inward part;

Faith in the only sacrifice
That can for sin atone;
To cast our hopes, to fix our eyes, On CHRIST, on CHRIST alone;

Patience to watch, and wait, and weep, Though mercy long delay;
Courage our fainting souls to keep, And trust Thee Though Thou slay;

Give these, and then Thy Will be Done:
Thus strengthened with all might, We, through Thy SPIRIT and Thy SON
Shall pray, and pray aright.
