HYMN 327

'Tis done! that new and heavenly
birth,
Which re-creates the Sons of earth,
Has cleansed from guilt of Adam's
A soul which JESUS died to win.

'Tis done! the cross upon the brow
Is marked for weal or sorrow now,
To shine with heavenly luster bright,
Or burn in everlasting night.

O ye who came that babe to lay
Within a SAVIOUR's Arms today,
Watch well and guard with careful
The heir of immortality.
Teach him to know a FATHER's love,
And seek for happiness above,
To CHRIST his heart and treasure give,
And in the SPIRIT ever live;

That so before the judgment-seat
In joy and triumph ye may meet;
The battle fought, the struggle o'er
The kingdom yours forevermore,

Praise GOD, from whom all blessings
flow,
Praise Him all creatures here below,
Praise Him above, Angelic host,
Praise FATHER, SON, and Holy
Ghost.
