HYMN 244

LORD, when we bend before Thy
And our confessions pour, Teach us to feel the sins we own, And hate what we deplore.

Our broken SPIRITS pitying see;
True penitence impart;
Then let a kindling glance from Thee Beam hope upon the heart.

When we disclose our wants in
prayer, May we our wills resign,
And not a Thought our bosoms share Which is not wholly thine.

May faith each weak petition fill, And waft it to the skies,
And teach our hearts ‘tis goodness That grants it or denies.
