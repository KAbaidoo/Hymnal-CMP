HYMN 444

Ye servants of our glorious King,
To Him your thankful praises bring;
And tell the deeds that grace has done, The triumphs by His Martyrs won.

Since they were faithful to the last, Their holy struggles now are past;
The bitterness of death is o’er
And theirs is bliss forevermore.

The flame might scorch, the knife
lay bare
And cruel beasts their members tear; No powers of earth, no powers of hell The souls that
loved their LORD
could quell.

Forever broken is the chain
That sought to bind them, but in vain;
O let us strive like them to win
Our freedom from the bonds of sin.

O SAVIOUR, may our portion be
With those who gave themselves to
Thee,
Through all eternity to sing
All praise to Thee the Martyr’s King.
