HYMN 52

Great GOD, what do I see and hear?
The end of things created;
The Judge of all men doth appear
On clouds of glory seated;
The trumpet sounds, the graves restore
The dead which they contained before; Prepare,
my soul, to meet Him.

The dead in CHRIST are first to rise
At that last trumpet’s sounding;
Caught up to meet Him in the skies,
With joy their LORD surrounding;
No gloomy fears their souls dismay;
His presence sheds eternal day
On those prepared to meet Him.

The ungodly, filled with guilty fears,
Behold His wrath prevailing;
In woe they rise, but all their tears
And sighs are unavailing:
The day of grace is past and gone;
Trembling they stand before His Throne,
All unprepared to meet Him.

Great Judge, to Thee our prayers we pour,
In deep abasement bending;
O shield us through that last dread hour,
Thy wondrous love extending;
May we, in this our trial day,
With faithful hearts Thy word obey,
And thus prepare to meet Thee.
