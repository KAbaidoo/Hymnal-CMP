HYMN 462 JOHN BAPTIST

Herald, in the wilderness
Breaking up the road,
Sinking mountains, raising plains, For the path of GOD;

Prophet, to the multitudes
Calling to repent,
In the way of righteousness
Unto Israel sent;

Messenger, GOD’s chosen one
Foremost to proclaim,
Proffered titles, passing by, Pointing to the Lamb;

Captive, for the world of truth Boldly witnessing;
Then in Herod’s dungeon-cave Faint and languishing;

Martyr, sacrifice to sin
At that feast of shame;
As his life foreshowed the LORD, In his death the same-

Holy JESUS, when He heard,
Went apart to pray:
Thus may we our lesson take
From His Saint to-day.
