HYMN 542

Stand up! – stand up for JESUS!
Ye soldiers of the Cross;
Lift high His royal banner,
It must not suffer loss.
From victory unto victory
His army He shall lead,
Til every foe is vanquished.
And CHRIST is LORD indeed.

Stand up! – stand up for JESUS!
The solemn watchword hear;
If while ye sleep He suffers,
Away with shame and fear;
Where’er ye meet with evil,
Within you or without
Charge for the GOD of battles, And put the foe to rout.

Stand up! – stand up for JESUS!
Stand in His strength alone;
The arm of flesh will fail you, Yet dare not trust your own,
Put on the Gospel armor,
Each piece put on with prayer; When duty calls or danger
Be never wanting there!

Stand up! – stand up for JESUS!
The strife will not be long;
This day the noise of battle,
The next the victor’s Song,
To him that overcometh,
A crown of life shall be,
He with the King of Glory
Shall reign eternally.
