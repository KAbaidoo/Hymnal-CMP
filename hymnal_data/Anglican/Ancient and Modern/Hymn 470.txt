HYMN 470 Ghost

GOD the FATHER, GOD the SON,
GOD the SPIRIT, THREE in ONE,
Hear us from Thy heavenly Throne,
Spare us Holy Trinity.

Holy SPIRIT, heavenly Dove,
Dew descending from above,
Breath of life, and fire of love,
Hear us, Holy SPIRIT.

Source of strength, of knowledge clear,
Understanding, counsel, fear,
Hear us, Holy SPIRIT.

Thou by whom the Virgin bore
Him whom heaven and earth adore,
Sent our nature to restore,
Hear us, Holy SPIRIT.

Thou whom JESUS from His Throne,
Gave to cheer and help His own,
That they might not be alone,
Hear us, Holy SPIRIT.

Comforter, to whom we owe
All that we rejoice to know
Of our SAVIOUR’s work below,
Hear us, Holy SPIRIT.

Thou whose sound Apostles hear,
Thou Whose power their SPIRITS stir’d,
Giving them the living Word,
Hear us, Holy SPIRIT.

Thou whose grace the church doth fill,
Showing her GOD’s perfect will,
Making JESUS present still,
Hear us, Holy SPIRIT.

Coming with Thy power to save,
Making on Baptismal wave,
Raising us from sin’s dark grave,
Hear us, Holy SPIRIT.

All our evil passions kill,
Bend aright our stubborn will,
Thou we grieve Thee, patient still:
Hear us, Holy SPIRIT.

Come to raise us when we fail,
And, when snares our souls enthrall,
Lead us back with gentle call;
Hear us, Holy SPIRIT.

Come to strengthen all the weak,
Give Thy courage to the meek.
