HYMN 386

The sower went forth sowing,
The seed in secret slept
Through weeks of faith and patience, Till out the green blade crept;
Aid warmed by golden
sunshine,
And fed by silver rain,
At last the fields were whitened To harvest once again.
O praise the heavenly sower,
Who gave the fruitful seed,
And watched and watered duly,
And ripened for our need.

Behold! the heavenly sower
Goes forth with better seed,
The word of sure salvation,
With feet and hands that bleed;
Here in His church scattered,
Our spirits are the soil;
Then let an ample fruitage
Repay His pain and toil
Oh, beauteous is the harvest
Wherein all goodness thrives,
And this the true thanksgiving, The first-fruits of our lives.
Within a hallowed acre
He sows yet other grain,
When peaceful earth receives
The dead He died to gain;
For though the growth be hidden, We know that they shall rise;
Yea even now they ripen
In sunny Paradise.
O summerland of harvest
O fields forever white with souls that wear Christ's raiment, With crowns of golden light!

One day the heavenly sower
Shall reap where He has sown,
And come again rejoicing,
And with Him bring His own;
And then the fan of judgment
Shall winnow from His floor
The chaff into the furnace
That flames evermore.
O holy, awful reaper,
Have mercy in the day
Thou puttest in Thy sickle,
And cast us not away.
