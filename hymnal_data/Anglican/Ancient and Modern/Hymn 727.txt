HYMN 727

Behold a little Child,
Laid in a manger bed;
The wintry blasts blow wild
Around His infant head,
But who is this so lowly laid?
‘Tis He by whom the worlds were made.

Alas! in what poor state
The SON of GOD is seen;
Why doth the LORD so great
Choose out a home so mean?
That we may learn from pride to flee,
And follow His humility.

Where Joseph plies his trade,
Lo! JESUS labours too;
The hands that all things made
An earthly craft pursue,
That weary men in Him may rest,
And faithful toil through Him be blest.

Among the doctors see
The Boy so full of grace;
Say, wherefore taketh He
The scholar’s lowly place?
That Christian boys, with reverence meet
May sit and learn at JESUS’ feet.

CHRIST! once Thyself a Boy,
Our boyhood guard and guide;
Be Thou its light and joy,
And still with us abide
That Thy dear love, so great and free,
May draw us evermore to Thee.
