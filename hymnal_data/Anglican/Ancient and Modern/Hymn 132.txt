HYMN 132

The day of resurrection!
Earth, tell it out abroad;
The Passover of gladness,
The Passover of GOD!
From earth unto the sky,
Our CHRIST hath brought us over
With hymns of victory.

Our hearts be pure from evil,
That we may see aright
The LORD in rays eternal
Of resurrection-light;
And, listening to His accents,
May hear so calm and plain
His own “All hail,” and hearing,
May raise the victor strain.

Now let the heavens be joyful,
And earth her song begin,
The round world keep high triumph,
And all that is therein;
Let all things seen and unseen
Their notes of gladness blend,
For CHRIST the LORD is risen,
Our joy that hath no end.
