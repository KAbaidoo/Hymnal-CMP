HYMN 198

O JESUS, Thou art standing
Outside the fast-closed door
In lowly patience waiting
To pass the threshold o’er:
Shame on us, Christian brethren, His Name and sign who bear,
Oh shame, thrice shame upon us
To keep Him standing there!

O JESUS, Thou art knocking:
And lo! that Hand is scarred
And thorns Thy Brow encircle,
And tears Thy face have marred:
O love that passeth knowledge
So patiently to wait!
O sin that hath no equal
So fast to bar the gate!

O JESUS, Thou art pleading
In accents meek and low,
“I died for you, My children,
And will ye treat Me so?”
O LORD, with shame and sorrow
We open now the door:
Dear SAVIOR, enter, enter,
And leave us never more.
