HYMN 757 FOR MARTYRS

Our LORD the path of suffering trod,
And since His blood for man hath flowed, 
'Tis meet that man should yield to GOD
The life he owned.
Hallelujah.

No shame to own the Crucified,-
Nay, 'tis our immortality
That we confess our GOD who died,
And for Him die, Hallelujah.

Filled with this Thought, with patient smile
All threats the Martyr doth withstand—
Fights, LORD, Thy cause, and leans the while
Upon thine hand.
Hallelujah.

Beholding his predestined crown,
Into death's arms he willing goes;
Dying, he conquers death: overthrown,
Overthrows his foes, Hallelujah.

LORD, make us thine own soldiers true,
Grant us brave faith, a SPIRIT pure,
That for Thy Name, the cross in view,
We may endure.
Hallelujah.

Eternal FATHER of the Word,
Eternal Word, we Thee adore,
Eternal SPIRIT, GOD and LORD
For evermore
Hallelujah.
