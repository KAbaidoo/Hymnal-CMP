HYMN 763 Intercession

GOD the FATHER, GOD the SON,
GOD the SPIRIT, THREE in ONE,
Hear us from Thy heavenly Throne, Spare us, Holy Trinity.

JESU, evermore adored,
As we claim Thy promised word,
Gathered in Thy Name, O LORD,
Hear us, we beseech Thee.

For Thy Church so dear to Thee, That she may forever be
Kept in peace and unity,
We beseech Thee, JESU.

For the rulers of our land,
That relying on Thy grace
They with patience run their race, We beseech Thee, JESU.

For Thy priests in every place, That relying on Thy grace
They with patience run their race, We beseech Thee, JESU.

All our loved ones we commend
LORD, to Thee, man’s truest Friend, Guard and guide them to the end, We beseech Thee, JESU.

Some on beds of sickness lie,
Some in want and hunger cry;
LORD, their every need supply,
We beseech Thee, JESU.

Some are lonely, some are sad,
Some have lost the joy they had; With true comfort make them glad, We beseech Thee, JESU.

Some are sunk in deadly sin
With no spark of love within;
In their souls Thy work begin,
We beseech Thee, JESU.

That whoever now doth lie
In his mortal agony,
To the last may feel Thee nigh, We beseech Thee, JESU.

That the souls for whom we pray Of the faithful passed away
May find mercy in that Day,
We beseech Thee, JESU.
