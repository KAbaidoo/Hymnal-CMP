HYMN 215

The Church’s one foundation
Is JESUS CHRIST her LORD:
She is His new creation
By water and the Word:
From Heav’n He came and sought
her
To be His holy Bride:
With His own Blood He bought her, And for her life He died.

Elect from every nation
Yet one o’er all the earth,
Her charter of salvation
One LORD, One Faith, One Birth, One Holy Name she blesses,
Partakes one Holy Food,
And to one hope she presses
With every grace endued.

Though with a scornful wonder
Men see her sore oppressed,
By schisms rent asunder,
By heresies distressed,
Yet Saints their watch are keeping Their cry goes up, “How long?”
And soon the night of weeping
Shall be the morn of song.

Mid toil, and tribulation,
And tumult of her war,
She waits the consummation
Of peace forevermore;
Till with the vision glorious
Her longing eyes are blest,
And the great Church victorious, Shall be the Church at rest.

Yet she on earth hath union
With GOD the THREE in ONE,
And mystics wet communion
With those whose rest is won;
O happy ones and holy!
LORD, give us grace that we,
Like them the meek and lowly,
On high may dwell with Thee.
