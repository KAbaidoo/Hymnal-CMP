HYMN 696

Awake, O LORD, as in the time of 
old!
Come, Holy SPIRIT, in Thy power 
and might;
For lack of Thee our hearts are 
strangely cold, Our minds but blindly groping 
towards the light.

Doubts are abroad: make Thou 
these doubts to cease!
Fears are within: set Thou these 
fears at rest!
Strife is among us: melt that strife 
to peace!
Change marches onward: may all 
change be blest!

Make us to be what we profess to be;
Let prayer be prayer, and praise 
be heart-felt praise; From unreality, O set us free,
And let our words be echoed by our 
ways.

Turn us, good LORD, and so shall 
we be turned:
Let every passion grieving Thee be 
stilled:
Then shall our race be won, our 
guerdon earned, Our Master looked on, and our joy 
fulfilled.
