HYMN 750 FOR A CHILD

FATHER, who hast gathered
This dear child to rest,
Unto Thee yield him,
Sure Thou knowest best.

Thou, O LORD, who gavest,
Dost Thine own reclaim:
Thou, O LORD, hast taken—
Blessed still Thy Name!-

Thine by right creative,
By redemption Thine,
By regeneration
And the holy sign.

Thou Who didst endow him
With baptismal grace
Now in love hast brought him to behold Thy face.

Safe from all earth’s sorrow
Safe from all its pains,
Now this child of Adam
Paradise regains:

Safe from all temptation,
Safe from fear of sin,
Through the Blood of sprinkling Holy, bright, and clean.

Lay we this dear body
In the earth to sleep,
His sweet soul come
Unto Thee to keep;

Looking for the dawning
Of that deathless day,
When all earthly shadows
Shall have fled away.

Only grant us, FATHER,
Courage in our strife,
And with him a portion
In unending life.

Saint James the
