HYMN 395

O Word of GOD above,
Who fillest all in all.
Hallow this house with Thy sure love, And bless our Festival.

Here from the font is poured
Grace on each sinful child;
The blessed anointing of the LORD
Brightens the once defiled.

Here CHRIST to faithful hearts
His Body gives for food;
The lamb of GOD Himself imparts The Chalice of His Blood.

Here guilty souls that pine
May health and pardon win;
The Judge acquits, and grace
Restores the dead in sin.

Yea, GOD enthroned on high
Here also dwells to bless;
Here trains adoring souls that sigh His mansions to possess.

Against this holy home
Rude tempests harmless beat,
And Satan’s angels fiercely come But to endure defeat.

All might, all praise be thine, FATHER, Co-equal SON,
And SPIRIT, Bond of love Divine While endless ages run.
