HYMN 614 Apostle

Behold, the Master passeth by!
Oh, seest Thou not His pleading eye?
With low sad voice He calleth Thee;-
Leave this vain world and follow Me.

O soul, bowed down with harrowing
care,
Hast Thou no Thought for Heaven
to spare?
From earthly toils lift up thine
eye;-
Behold, the Master passeth by!

One heard Him calling long ago,
And straightway left all things below Counting his earthly gain as loss
For JESUS and His blessed Cross.

That “Follow Me” his faithful ear
Seemed everyday afresh to hear:
Its echoes stirred his SPIRIT still, And fired his hope, and nerved his
will.

GOD sweetly calls us everyday:
why should we then our bliss delay?
He calls to Heaven and endless light: Why should we love the dreary night?

Praise, LORD, to Thee for Matthew’s
call,
At which he left his earthly all;
Thou, LORD, even now art calling
me,-
I will leave all, and follow Thee.
