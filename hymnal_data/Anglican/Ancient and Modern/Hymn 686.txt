HYMN 686

The voice says, cry! what shall we
cry? "All flesh is grass, and like the
Its glories droop, its pleasures die, Its joys but last one fleeting hour,"

The voice says, Cry! O piteous cry!
And are there none to help and
save?
Have all that live beneath the sky
No other prospect but a grave?

The voice says, Cry! Yet glorious cry!
The word of GOD can never fail,
And tells how JESUS, Throned on high, Holds out eternal life to all.

The voice says, Cry! who needs the
cry?
O brother men! who needs it not?
By countless millions, far and night, "Tis still unheard, despised, forgot.

The voice says, cry! what stops the
cry?
Our greed of wealth, our love of ease, Our lack of earnest will to try
Mankind to save, and GOD to please.

The voice says, Cry! O let us cry!
Thou standing on death's awful
brink, Men feast, they jest, they sell, they buy, And cannot see, and will not think.

The voice says, Cry! LORD, we
would cry,
But of Thy goodness teach us how;
For fast the hours of mercy fly,
And, if we cry, it must be now!
