HYMN 678

GOD is a stronghold and a tower, A help that never faileth,
A covering shield, a sword of power When Satan’s host assaileth
In vain our crafty foe
Still strives to work us woe,
Still lurks and lies in wait
With more than earthly hate;
We will not faint, nor tremble.

Frail sinners are we:- bought re-For hope or consolation. [mains Save in His strength whom GOD
Our Captain of salvation. [ordains Yes, ………. CHRIST alone
The …………. host we own
GOD……… the world began
The word-made flesh for man,
Still conquering, and to conquer
It …………………. striveth the hosts of ill Within us, and around us.

With fiendish strength and fiendish skill,
Yet ne’er may they confound us
Man’s night of dark despair,
When storm-clouds fill the air, Is GOD’s triumphal hour,
The noon-day of His power
One word, and He prevaileth.

Our FATHER’s truth abideth sure, CHRIST, our redeemer, liveth;
For us He pleads His offering pure To us His SPIRIT giveth,
Though dear ones pass away,
Though strength and life decay,
Yet loss shall be our gain,
For GOD doth still remain
Our All-in-all forever.
