HYMN 723

How glorious is the life above,
Which in this ordinance we taste;
That fullness of celestial love,
That joy which shall forever last,

That heavenly life in CHRIST concealed
These earthen vessels could not bear; The part which now we find revealed
No tongue of Angels can declare.

The light of life eternal darts
Into our souls a dazzling ray;
A drop of heaven o’erflows our hearts, And deluges the house of clay.

Sure pledge of ecstasies unknown
Shall this Divine Communion be;
The rays shall rise into a sun,
The drop shall swell into a sea.
