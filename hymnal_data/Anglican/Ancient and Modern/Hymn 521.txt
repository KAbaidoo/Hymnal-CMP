HYMN 521

Thrice-Holy Name! that sweeter
sounds
Than streams which down the valley
run,
And tells of more than human love,
And more than human power, in
one;
First from the gracious herald heard, Hear I since through all the choirs on high;

O Child of Mary, SON of GOD,
Eternal, hear Thy children’s cry!
While at the blessed Name we bow
LORD JESUS, be among us now!

Within our dim eyed souls call up
The vision of thine earthly years;
The mount of the transfigured form; The Garden of the bitter tears;
The cross unprepared in darkening
skies;
The thorn-wreathed Head, the
bleeding side;
And whisper in the heart, “For you, For you, I left the Heavens, and
died,”
While at the blessed Name we bow
LORD JESUS, be among us now!

Ah! with faith’s inward piercing eye The riven rock-hewn bed we see,
Whence Thou in triumph hast gone
forth
By death from death to make us
free!
And when on earth’s last awful day
The Judgment-seat of GOD shall
shine.
Lift Thou our trembling eyes to read In Thy dear face the mercy-sign
While at the blessed name we bow,
LORD JESUS, be among us now.
