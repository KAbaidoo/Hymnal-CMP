HYMN 355

LORD, pour Thy SPIRIT from on high, And thine ordained servants bless; Graces and 
gifts to each supply, 
And clothe Thy Priests with 
righteousness. 

Within Thy temple when they stand, To teach the truth as taught by Thee, SAVIOUR like 
stars in Thy right hand, Let all Thy Church’s Pastors be. 

Wisdom, and zeal, and faith impart, Firmness with meekness, from above, To bear Thy
people in their heart, And love the souls whom Thou dost love: 

To watch, and pray, and never faint, By day and night their guard to keep, To warn the 
sinner, cheer the saint, To feed Thy lambs, and tend Thy sheep, 
So, when their work is finished here, May they in hope their charge resign; So, when their 
Master shall appear, May they with crowns of glory shine. 

These Hymns for Ember Days are 
also suitable for meeting of Clergy.
