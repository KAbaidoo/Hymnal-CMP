HYMN 478 Sunday

This is the day the LORD hath made, He calls the hours His own;
Let heaven rejoice, let earth be glad, And praise surround the Throne.

Today He rose and left the dead, And satan’s empire fell;
Today the saints His triumphs spread, And all His wonders tell.

Hosanna to th’ anointed King,
To David’s Holy SON!
Make haste to help us, LORD, and bring Salvation from Thy Throne.

Blessed be the LORD, who comes to men
With messages of grace;
Who comes, in GOD His FATHER’s Name,
To save our sinful race.

Hosanna in the highest strains
The Church on earth can raise;
The highest heavens in which He reigns
Shall give Him nobler praise.
