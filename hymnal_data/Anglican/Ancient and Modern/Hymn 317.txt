HYMN 317

MY GOD, and is Thy Table spread,
And doth Thy Cup with love o’erflow?
Thither be all Thy children led,
And let them all Thy sweetness know.

Hail, sacred Feast, which JESUS makes, Rich banquet of His Flesh and Blood!
Thrice happy he who here partakes
That sacred Stream, that heavenly Food.

Why are its dainties all in vain
Before unwilling hearts displayed?
Was not for them the Victim slain?
Are they forbid the children’s Bread?

O let Thy Table honored be,
And furnished well with joyful guests; And may each soul salvation see,
That here its sacred pledges tastes.

To FATHER, SON, and HOLY GHOST,
The GOD Whom heaven and earth adore,
From men and from the Angel-host
Be praise and glory evermore.
