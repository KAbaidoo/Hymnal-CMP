HYMN 661

Lift up Thyself; my soul,
Above this world’s control!
Spend and be spent in only hymns of praise
Be arm’d with pure desire,
Burn with celestial fire;
Unto the King of kings our voice we raise; To Him a crown we
weave, and
bring offering.
A sacrifice of words, a bloodless
Thee on the troubled deep,
Thee o’er the islands steep,
Thee through the mighty continents of lands,
Thee in the city’s throng,
Or mountain tops along
Or when in celebrated plains I stand, Thee, Thee, O blessed One, I sing, Thee, Thee, O
FATHER of the world, Eternal King!

Thy praise I hymn by night,
Thy praise at morning light,
Thy praise by day, Thy praise at even-This know the hoary stars, And moon with silver
bars,
And chiefly……. that doth on high preside
O’er all the host of heaven, the ……
Who measuring time for holy souls his course doth run.

O Mind immutable!
O Light inscrutable!
Thine is the eye that guides the
lightning fire, In Thee the ages live
Thou dost their limits give,
Who can Thy praises reach, Eternal Sire?
Thou art beyond the dreams ………
Beyond the reach of mind, or highest angel’s ken.

O’er all Thy rule is spread,
The living and the dead;
To minds that be, the parent ………….
Thou art; All heaven Thou dost control,
Thou nourishes the soul,
And dost to SPIRIT energy impart, The Spring Thou art when earth
thing flow; And from eternity the Root when all things grow.
