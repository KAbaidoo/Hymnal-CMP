HYMN 54
FOR A LATE EVENING SERVICE

When shades of night around us close,
And weary limbs in sleep repose,
The faithful soul awake may be,
And longing sigh, O LORD, to Thee.

Thou true desire of nations, hear,
Thou Word of GOD, Thou Saviour dear;
In pity heed our humble cries,
And bid at length the fallen rise.

O come, redeemer, come and free
Thine own from guilt and misery;
The gates of heav’n again unfold,
Which Adam’s sin had closed of old.

All praise, eternal SON, to Thee,
Whose advent sets Thy people free,
Whom with the FATHER we adore
And HOLY GHOST for evermore.
