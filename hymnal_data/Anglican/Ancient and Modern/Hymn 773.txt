HYMN 773

O my SAVIOR, lifted
From the earth for me,
Draw me, in Thy mercy,
Nearer unto Thee.

Lift my earth-bound longings, Fix them, LORD, above;
Draw me with the magnet
Of Thy mighty love.

LORD Thine arms are stretching Ever far and wide,
To enfold Thy children
To Thy loving side.

And I come, O JESUS:-
Dare I turn away?
No! Thy love hath conquered, And I come to-day;

Bringing all my burdens,
Sorrow, sin, and care,
At Thy feet I lay them,
And I leave them there.
