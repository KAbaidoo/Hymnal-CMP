HYMN 291

Oft in danger, oft in woe,
Onward, Christians, onward go;
Bear the toil, maintain the strife, Strengthened with the bread of Life!

Let not sorrow dim your eye,
Soon shall every tear be dry;
Let not fears your course impede, Great your strength if great your need.

Let your drooping hearts be glad
March in heavenly armour clad;
Fight, nor think the battle long, Soon shall victory wake your Song.

Onward then in battle move;
More than conquerors you shall prove; Though opposed by many a foe,
Christian soldiers, onward go!

Hymns of glory and of praise,
FATHER, unto Thee we raise:
Holy JESUS, praise to Thee
With the SPIRIT ever be.
