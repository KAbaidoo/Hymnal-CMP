HYMN 489 Septuagesima

O GOD, the joy of Heav’n above,
Thou didst not need Thy creatures’
love,
When from Thy secret place of rest
Thy word the earth’s foundations
blest.

Thou spakest; -worlds began to be; They bow before Thy Majesty;
And all to their Creator raise
A wondrous harmony of praise.

But ere, O LORD, this lovely earth From Thy creative will had birth,
Thou in Thy counsels didst unfold
Another world of fairer mold.

That realm shall our Redeemer
frame,
And build upon His mighty Name;
His Hand the word of power shall
sow
That all the earth His truth may
Know.

When time itself has passed away,
His Church, secure in Heav’n for aye, Shall share His table and His Throne, And GOD
The Father reign alone.

O FATHER, SON, and SPIRIT Blest
One GOD in Heav’n and earth confessed, Preserve, direct, and fill with love Thy realm on
earth, Thy realm above.
