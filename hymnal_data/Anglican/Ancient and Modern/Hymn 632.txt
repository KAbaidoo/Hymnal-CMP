HYMN 632

Redeemed, restored, forgiven
Through JESUS’ precious Blood, Heirs of His home in heaven
O praise our Savior
Praise Him in tuneful song
Who gave His SON to die!
Praise Him whose sevenfold treasures Enrich and sanctify!

Once on the dreary mountain
We wandered far and wide,
Far from the cleansing fountain, Far from the pierced side
But JESUS sought and found us, And washed our guilt away;
With cords of love He bound us To be His own for aye.

Dear Master, Thine the glory
Of each recovered soul;
Ah! who can tell the story
Of love that made us whole?
Not ours, not ours the merit:
Be thine alone the praise,
And ours a thankful SPIRIT
To serve Thee all our days.

Now keep us, Holy SAVIOR,
In Thy true love and fear;
And grant us of Thy favor
The grace to persevere;
Til, in Thy new creation,
Earth’s time-long travail o’er We find our full salvation,
And praise Thee evermore.
