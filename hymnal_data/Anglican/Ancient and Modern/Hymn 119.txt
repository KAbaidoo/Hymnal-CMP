HYMN 119

His are the Thousand sparkling rills, That from a Thousand fountains burst, And fill with
music all the hills; And yet He saith, “I thirst.”

All fiery pangs on battle-fields,
On fever beds where sick men toss, Are in that human cry He yield,
To anguish on the cross.

But more than pains that racked Him then
Was the deep longing thirst divine That thirsted for the souls of men; Dear LORD! And
one was mine

O love most patient, give me grace; Make all my soul athirst for Thee; That parched dry
Lip, that fading
That thirst were all for me. Face.
