HYMN 623 Saints

Give us the wings of faith to rise
Within the veil, and see
The Saints above, how great their
How bright their glories be. [joys,

Once they were mourning here
below,
And wet their couch with tears;
They wrestled hard, as we do now,
With sins, and doubts, and fears.

We ask them whence their victory
They, with united breath, [came;
Ascribed the conquest to the Lamb,
Their triumph to His Death.

They marked the footsteps that He
His zeal inspired their breast;
And, following their incarnate GOD,
They reached the promised rest.

Our glorious Leader claims our praise
For His own pattern given;
While the great cloud of witnesses
Show the same path to heav’n.
