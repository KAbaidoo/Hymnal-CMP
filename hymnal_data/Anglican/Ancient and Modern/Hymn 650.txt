HYMN 650 Easter

Hail, festal day, whose glory never
ends;
Now hell is vanquished, CHRIST to
heaven ascends,

All nature with new births of beauty
gay today.
Acknowledged her LORD’s return
Hail festal day, &c.

The Crucified is King; creation’s
prayer
To its Creator rises everywhere.
Hail festal day, &c.

Let what Thou promised, fair
Power, be done;
One, the third day shines; arise, O buried
Hail festal day, &c.

It cannot be that Joseph’s sepulcher
Should keep the whole world’s Ransom prisoner.
Hail festal day, &c.

No rock of stone His passage can
withstand,
His hand, Who gathers all the world within.
Hail festal day, &c.

Leave to the grave Thy grave—
clothes; let them fall;
Without Thee we have naught, and
with Thee all,
Hail festal day, &c.

Thou gavest life, and dost endure
the grave;
Thou tread’st the way of death,
from death to save.
Hail festal day, &c.

Bring back the day, - Thy dying
made it night,
That ages in Thy face may see the light.
Hail festal day, &c.

Thy rescued are like sand beside the
sea
And where their SAVIOUR goes, they
follow free.
Hail festal day, &c.

The law of death has ceased the
world to light,
And darkness quails before the face
of light.
Hail festal day, &c.
