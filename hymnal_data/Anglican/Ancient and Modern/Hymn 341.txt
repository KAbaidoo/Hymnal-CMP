HYMN 341

Come, sing with holy gladness,
High Alleluias sing,
Uplift your loud Hosannas
To JESUS LORD and King:

Sing, boys, in joyful chorus
Your hymn of praise today,
And sing, ye gentle maidens,
Your sweet responsive lay,

‘Tis good for boys and maidens Sweet hymns to CHRIST to sing,
‘Tis meet that children’s voices Should praise the children’s King; For JESUS is
salvation
And glory, grace, and maiden
The one Redeemer Blest.

O boys, be strong in JESUS,
To toil for Him is gain,
And JESUS wrought with Joseph
With chisel, saw and plane
O maidens, live for JESUS,
Who was a maiden’s SON;
Be patient, pure, and gentle,
And perfect grace begun.

Soon in the golden city
The boys and girls shall play,
And through the dazzling mansions Rejoice in endless day;
O CHRIST, prepare Thy children
With that triumphant throng
To pass the burnished portals,
And sing th’ eternal Song.
