HYMN 10
The Sixth Hour

O GOD of truth, O LORD of might,
Who ord'rest time and change aright,
Brightening the morn with golden gleams,
Kindling the noonday’s fiery beams

Quench Thou in us the flames of strife,
From passion's heat preserve our life,
Our bodies keep from perils free,
And give our souls true peace in Thee.

Almighty FATHER, hear our cry
Through JESUS CHRIST our LORD Most High,
Who with the HOLY GHOST and Thee
Doth live and reign eternally.
