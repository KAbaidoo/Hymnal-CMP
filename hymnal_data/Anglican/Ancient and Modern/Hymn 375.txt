HYMN 375

Great King of nations, hear our 
While at Thy feet we fall, prayer, And humbly with united cry 
To Thee for mercy call; 
The guilt is ours, but grace is thine, O turn us not away; 
But hear us from Thy lofty Throne, And help us when we pray.

Our FATHERs’ sins were manifold, 
And ours no less we own, 
Yet wondrously from age to age 
Thy goodness hath been shown;

When dangers, like a stormy sea, 
Beset our country round, cried, To Thee we looked to Thee we 
And help in Thee was found.

With one consent we meekly bow 
Beneath Thy chastening hand, 
And, pouring forth confession meet, Mourn with our mourning land, 
With pitying eye behold our need, 
As thus we lift our prayer; LORD, Correct us with Thy judgments, 
Then let Thy mercy spare.
