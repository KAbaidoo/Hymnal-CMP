HYMN 751 Apostle

Two brothers freely cast their lot With David’s royal SON;
The cost of conquest counting not They deem the battle won.

Brothers in heart, they hope to gain An undivided joy,
That man may one with man remain As boy was one with boy.

CHRIST heard; and willed that James should fall First prey of Satan’s rage:
John linger out his fellows all, And die in bloodless age.

Now they join hands once more above Before the Conqueror’s Throne!
Thus GOD grants prayer: but in His love
Makes times and ways His own.

All glory to the FATHER be,
All glory to the SON,
All glory, HOLY GHOST, to Thee
While endless ages run.
