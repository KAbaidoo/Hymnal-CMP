HYMN 126 part 1

Light’s glittering morn bedecks the sky;
Heav’n thunders forth its victor-cry;
The glad earth shouts her triumph high,
And groaning hell makes wild reply;
While He, the King, the mighty King,
Despoiling death of all its sting,
And, trampling down the powers of night,
Brings forth His ransom’d Saints to light
His tomb of late the threefold guard
Of watch and stone and seal had barr’d;
But now in pomp and triumph high,
He comes from death to victory

The pains of hell are loosed at last;
The days of mourning now are past;
An angel robed in light hath said
“The LORD is risen from the dead.”

Part 2
Th’ Apostles’ hearts were full of pain
For their dear LORD so lately slain,
By rebel servants doom’d to die
A death of cruel agony.

With gentle voice the Angel gave
The women tidings at the grave:
“Fear not, your Master shall ye see;
He goes before to Galilee.”

Then, hastening on their eager way
The joyful tidings to convey,
Their LORD they met, their living LORD
And falling at His Feet adored.

The Eleven, when they hear, with speed
To Galilee forthwith proceed,
That there once more they may behold
The LORD’s dear face, as He foretold.

Part 3
That Easter-tide with joy was bright,
The sun shone out with fairer light,
When, to their longing eyes restored,
Th’ Apostles saw their risen LORD.

He bade them see His Hands, His Side,
Where yet the glorious wounds abide;
The tokens true which made it plain
Their LORD indeed was risen again.

JESU, the King of Gentleness,
Do Thou Thyself our hearts possess,
That we may give Thee all our days,
The tribute of our grateful praise.

The following may be sung at the end
Of each part:-

O LORD of all, with us abide
In this our joyful Easter-tide
From every weapon death can wield
Thine own redeem’d forever shield.

All praise be Thine, O risen LORD,
From death to endless life restored;
All praise to GOD the FATHER be
And HOLY GHOST eternally.
