HYMN 668

I lift my heart to Thee,
Saviour Divine;
For Thou art all to me,
And I am thine,
Is there on earth a closer bond than this,-
That my beloved’s mine, and I am His?

Thine am I by all ties:
But chiefly thine,
That through Thy sacrifice
Thou, LORD, art mine,
By thine own cords of love, so
sweetly wound Around me, I to Thee am closely bound.

To Thee, Thou bleeding Lamb
I all things owe—
All that I have, and am,
And all I know,
All that I have is now no longer mine, And I am not mine own; LORD, I am thine.

How can I, LORD, withhold
Life’s brightest hour
From Thee; or gathered gold,
Or any power?
Why should I keep one precious
thing from Thee: When Thou hast given thine own dear self for me?

I pray Thee, SAVIOUR, keep
Me in Thy love,
Until death’s holy sleep
Shall me remove
To that fair realm where, sin and sorrow o’er,
Thou and thine own are one for evermore.
