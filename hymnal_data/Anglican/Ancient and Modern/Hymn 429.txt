HYMN 429

O heavenly Jerusalem,
Of everlasting halls,
Thrice blessed are the people
Thou storest in Thy walls.

Thou art the golden mansion,
Where Saints forever sing,
The seat of God’s own chosen,
The palace of the King.

There God forever sitteth,
Himself of all the crown:
The Lamb, the Light that shineth, And never goeth down.

Naught to his seat approacheth
Their sweet peace to molest;
They sing their God forever,
Nor day nor night they rest.

Sure hope doth thither lead us;
Our longings thither tend;
May short-lived toil ne’er daunt us For joys that cannot end.

To Christ the Sun that lightens
His Church above, below,
To Father, and to Spirit,
All things created bow.
The Hymns for this Festival may be used on other days.
