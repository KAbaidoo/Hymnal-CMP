HYMN 22

HOLY FATHER, cheer our way
With Thy love’s perpetual ray:
Grant us every closing day
Light at evening time.

HOLY SAVIOUR, calm our fears
When earth’s brightness disappears
Grant us in our later years
Light at evening time.

HOLY SPIRIT, be Thou nigh
When in mortal pains we lie;
Grant us, as we come to die,
Light at evening time.

HOLY, Blessed TRINITY!
Darkness is not dark with Thee;
Those Thou keepest always see
Light at evening time.
