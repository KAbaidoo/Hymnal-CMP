HYMN 476 Evening

Behold the sun, that seemed but
Enthroned overhead, now beginneth to decline below
The globe whereon we tread:
And he, whom yet we look upon
With comfort and delight,
Will quite depart from hence anon, And leave us to the night.

Thus time, unheeded, steals away The life which nature gave;
Thus are our bodies every day
Declining to the grave;
Thus from us all our pleasures fly Whereon we set our heart,
And when the night
of death draws Thus will they all depart.

LORD! Though the sun forsake our sight, And mortal hopes are vain;
Let still thine
everlasting light Within our souls remain;
And in the nights of our distress Vouchsafe those rays divine,
Which from the sun
of righteousness For ever brightly shine.
