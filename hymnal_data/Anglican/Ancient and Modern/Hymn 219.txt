HYMN 219

Hail the LORD’s anointed,
Great David’s greater SON!
Hail, in the time appointed
His reign on earth begun!
He comes to break oppression,
To set the Captive free
To take away transgression
And rule in equity.

He shall come down like showers Upon the fruitful earth,
And joy and hope, like flowers, Spring in His path to birth:
Before Him on the mountains
Shall peace, the herald, go:
From hill to vale the fountains Of righteousness o’erflow.

Kings shall bow down before Him, And gold and incense bring:
All nations shall adore Him.
His praise all people sing:
To Him shall prayer unceasing
And daily vows ascend:
His kingdom still increasing,
A kingdom without end.

Ever every foe victorious,
He on His Throne shall rest:
From age to age more glorious, All-blessing and all-blest
The tide of time shall never
His covenant remove;
His Name shall stand forever, His changeless Name of love.
