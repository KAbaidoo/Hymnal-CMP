HYMN 741 Absent Friends

For the dear ones parted from us
We would raise our hymns of prayer; By the tender love which watcheth
Round Thy children everywhere,
Holy FATHER,
Keep them ever in Thy care.

Through each trial and temptation, Dangers faced by night and day,
By the infinite compassion
Pleading for the souls that stray, Loving SAVIOUR,
Keep them in the narrow way.

In their hours of doubt and sorrow, When their faith is sorely tried,
By the grace divine which strengthens Souls for whom the SAVIOUR died Gracious SPIRIT,
Be Thou evermore their guide.

In their joys, by friends surrounded, In their strife, by foes oppressed May Thy blessing
still be with them, May Thy presence give them rest
GOD Almighty,
FATHER, SON, and SPIRIT blest.
