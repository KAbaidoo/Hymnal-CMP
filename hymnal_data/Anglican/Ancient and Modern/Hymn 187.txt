HYMN 187

Behold the Lamb of GOD!
O Thou for sinners slain,
Let it not be in vain
That Thou hast died: Thee for my SAVIOUR let me take, My only refuge let me make
Thy pierced side.

Behold the Lamb of GOD!
Into the sacred flood
Of Thy most precious Blood
My soul I cast: -within Wash me and make me clean
And keep me pure from every sin, Til life be past.

Behold the Lamb of GOD!
All hail, incarnate word,
Thou everlasting LORD,
SAVIOUR most Blest; Fill us with love that never faints, Grant us with all Thy blessed
saints Eternal rest.

Behold the Lamb of GOD!
Worthy is His alone
To sit upon the Throne
Of GOD above; One with the Ancient of all days, One with the Comforter in praise, All
Light and Love.
