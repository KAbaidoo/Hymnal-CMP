HYMN 458 LATIN GATE

An exile for the faith
Of his incarnate LORD,
Beyond the stars, beyond all space, His soul in vision soared:

There saw in glory Him
Who liveth, and was dead
There Judah’s Lion, and the Lamb That for our ransom bled:

There of the Kingdom learned
The mysteries sublime;
How, sown in Martyrs’ blood, the faith Should spread from clime to clime.

LORD, give us grace, like him,
In Thee to live and die;
To spurn the fleeting things of earth, And seek for joys on high.

JESU, our risen LORD,
We praise Thee and adore,
Who art with GOD the FATHER One And SPIRIT evermore.
