HYMN 208

O Holy SPIRIT, LORD of grace, Eternal fount of love,
Inflame, we pray, our inmost hearts With fire from heav'n above.

As Thou in bond of love dost join The FATHER and the SON,
So fill us all with mutual love, And knit our hearts in one.

All glory to the FATHER be,
All glory to the SON,
All glory, HOLY GHOST, to Thee, While endless ages run.
