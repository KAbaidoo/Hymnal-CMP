HYMN 502

To Thee and to Thy CHRIST, O GOD, We sing – we ever sing;
For He the lonely winepress trod, Our cup of joy to bring,
His glorious arm the strife maintained, He marched in might from far;
His robes were with the vintage stained,
Red with the wine of war.

To Thee and to Thy CHRIST, O GOD, We sing – we ever sing;
For He invaded Death's abode,
And robbed him of his sting.
The house of dust enthralls no more, For He, the strong to save,
Himself doth guard that silent door, Great Keeper of the grave.

To Thee and to Thy CHRIST, O GOD, We sing – we ever thus;
For He hath crushed beneath His rod The world's proud rebel king.
He plunged in His imperial strength To gulfs of darkness down;
He brought His trophy up at length, The Arm that set us free;
Glory, O GOD, for evermore
Be to Thy CHRIST and Thee.
