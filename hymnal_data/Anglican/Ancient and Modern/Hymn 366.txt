HYMN 366

We give Thee but thine own,
What’er the gift may be:
All that we have is thine alone, A trust, O LORD, from Thee.

May we Thy bounties thus
As stewards true receive.
And gladly, as Thou blesses us, To Thee our first-fruits give.

Oh, hearts are bruised and dead, And homes are bare and cold,
And lambs, for whom the Shepherd Are straying from the fold.

To comfort and to bless,
To find a balm for woe,
To tend the lone and fatherless Is Angels’ work below.

The captive to release,
To GOD the lost to bring,
To teach the way of life and peace, It is a CHRIST-like thing.

And we believe Thy Word,
Though dim our faith may be;
Whate’er for thine we do, O LORD, We do it unto Thee.

All might, all praise be thine, FATHER, Co-equal SON,
And SPIRIT, Bond of love Divine, While endless ages run.
