HYMN 671

Breathe on me, Breath of GOD, Fill me with life anew,
That I may love what Thou dost love, And do what Thou wouldst do.

Breathe on me, Breath of GOD, Until my heart is pure;
Until with Thee I will one will To do and to endure.

Breathe on me, Breath of GOD, Till I am wholly thine;
Until this earthly part of me Glows with Thy fire divine.

Breathe on me, Breath of GOD, So shall I never die,
But live with Thee the perfect life Of thine eternity.
