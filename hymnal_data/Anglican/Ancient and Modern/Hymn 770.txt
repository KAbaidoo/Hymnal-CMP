HYMN 770

I wandered sore distress'd
All weary and forlorn;
I had no place to rest,
Of all my pleasures shorn—
My thirsting SPIRIT sighed,
And in the desert cried.

The Shepherd heard my cry,
Who came His flock to find,
And drew in mercy nigh,
For He is wondrous kind;
His winning voice awoke
My SPIRIT as He spoke.

He bade my wandering cease
And gave my heart a home,
That from the bliss of peace
I might no longer roam
He... hope for fears.
And lasting joy for tears.
