HYMN 140

JESUS lives! no longer now
Can Thy terrors, death, appall us;
JESUS lives! By this we know
Thou, O grave, canst not enthrall us.
Hallelujah!

JESUS lives! henceforth is death
But the gate of life immortal;
This shall calm our trembling breath,
When we pass its gloomy portal.
Hallelujah!

JESUS lives! for us He died;
Then, alone to JESUS living,
Pure in heart may we abide,
Glory to our Saviour giving.
Hallelujah!

JESUS lives: our hearts know well
Nought from us His love shall sever;
Life, nor death, nor powers of hell
Tear us from His keeping ever.
Hallelujah!

JESUS lives! to Him the Throne
Over all the world is given;
May we go where He is gone,
Rest and reign with Him in Heaven.
Hallelujah!
