HYMN 225

Brief life is here our portion; Brief sorrow, short-lived care; The life that knows no ending, The tearless life, is there

Oh happy retribution! Short toil, eternal rest; For mortals and for sinners A mansion with the blest!

And now we fight the battle, But then shall wear the crown Of full and everlasting And passionless renown:

And now we watch and struggle, And now we live in hope And Zion in her anguish With Babylon must cope;

But He, whom now we trust in, Shall then be seen and known; And they that know and see Him Shall have Him for their own.

The morning shall awaken, The shadows shall decay, And each true-hearted servant Shall shine as doth the day.

There GOD, our King and Portion, In fulness of His grace, Shall we behold forever, And worship face to face.

O sweet and blessed country, The home of GOD's elect! O sweet and blessed country That eager hearts expect!

JESU, in mercy bring us To that dear land of rest; Who art, with GOD the FATHER And SPIRIT, ever blest.
