HYMN 649 CROSS

O perfect GOD, Thy love
As perfect Man did share
Here upon earth each form of ill Thy fellow-men must bear.

Now from the tree of scorn
We hear Thy voice again;
Thou who didst take our mortal flesh,
Hast felt our mortal pain.

Thy Body suffers thirst,
Parched are Thy lips and dry:
How poor the offering man can bring
Thy thirst to satisfy!

O SAVIOUR, by Thy thirst
Borne on the cross of agony,
Grant us in all our sufferings here
To glorify Thy Name:

That through each pain and grief
Our souls may onward move
To gain more likeness to Thy life
More knowledge of Thy love.
