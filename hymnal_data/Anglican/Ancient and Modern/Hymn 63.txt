HYMN 63
FOR A LATE EVENING SERVICE

O SAVIOR LORD to Thee we pray,
Whose love has kept us safe today,
Protect us through the coming night,
And ever save us by Thy might.

Be with us now, in mercy high,
And spare Thy servants when they cry;
Our sins blot out, our prayers receive,
Thy light throughout our darkness give.

Let not dull sleep the soul oppress,
Nor secret foe the heart possess;
Our flesh keep chaste, that it may be
A holy temple meet for Thee.

To Thee, who dost our hearts renew,
With fervent prayer we humbly sue,
The pure in thought and free from stain
We from our beds may rise again.

All praise to GOD the FATHER be,
All praise, eternal SON, to Thee,
Whom with the SPIRIT we adore
Forever and evermore.

This Hymn may also be sung on Holy Days, except from Ash Wednesday to
White Sunday.
