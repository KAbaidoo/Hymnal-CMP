HYMN 222

Ten Thousand times ten Thousand, In sparkling raiment bright,
The armies of the ransom’d saints Throng up the steeps of light: “Tis finished! all is
finished, Their fight with death and sin; Fling open wide the golden gates, And let the victors in.

What rush of Alleluias
Fills all the earth and sky!
What ringing of a Thousand harps Bespeaks the triumph nigh!
O day, for which creation
And all its tribes were made!
O joy, for all its former woes
A Thousand-fold repaid!

Oh, then what raptured greetings On Canaan’s happy shore
What knitting severed friendships up,
Where partings are no more!
Then eyes with joy shall sparkle That brimmed with tears of late; Orphans no longer
Fatherless,
Nor widows desolate.

Bring near Thy great salvation, Thou Lamb for sinners slain,
Fill up the roll elect,
Then take Thy power and reign:
Appear, Desire of Nations,
Thine exiles long for home;
Show in the heavens Thy promised sign;
Thou Prince and Saviour come.
