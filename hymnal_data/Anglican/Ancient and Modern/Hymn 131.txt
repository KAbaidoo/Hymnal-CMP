HYMN 131

CHRIST the LORD is risen today
Christians, haste our vows to pay; Of ye your praises meet
At the Paschal Victim’s feet.
For the sheep the Lamb hath bled
Sinless in the sinner’s stead;
“CHRIST is risen,” today we cry;
Now He lives no more to die,

CHRIST, the Victim undefiled,
Man to GOD hath reconciled;
Whilst in strange and awful strife Met together Death and Life;
Christians, on this happy day
Haste with joy your vows to pay;
“CHRIST is risen,” today we cry;
Now He lives no more to die.

CHRIST, who once for sinners bled, Now the first-born from the dead,
Throne in endless might and power, Lives and reigns forevermore,
Hail, eternal Hope on high!
Hail, Thou King of victory!
Hail, Thou Prince of life adored!
Help and save us, gracious LORD.
