HYMN 535

LORD, it belongs not to my care
Whether I die or live;
To love and serve Thee is my share, And this Thy grace must give.

If life belong, oh make me glad
The longer to obey;
If short, no laborer is sad
To end his toilsome day.

CHRIST leads me through no darker
rooms
Than He went through before;
He that unto GOD’s kingdom comes
Must enter by this door.

Come, LORD, when grace hath made
Thy blessed face to see:
For if Thy work on earth be sweet, What will Thy glory be!

Then I shall end my sad complaints
And weary sinful days,
And join with the triumphant saints
That sing my SAVIOUR’s praise.

My knowledge of that life is small, But ‘tis enough that CHRIST knows
And I shall be with Him.
