HYMN 655 General Hymns

I bind unto myself today
The strong name of the Trinity,
By invocation of the same,
The THREE in ONE, and One in Three.

I bind this day to me forever,
By power of faith, CHRIST’s incarnation;
His baptism in the Jordan river;
His death on Cross for my salvation,
His bursting from the spiced tomb;
His riding up the heavenly way;
His coming at the day of doom:
I bind unto myself today.

I bind unto myself the power
Of the great love of Cherubim;
The sweet “Well done” in judgment hour;
The service of the Seraphim,
Confessors’ faith, Apostles’ word,
The Patriarchs’ prayers, the Prophets’ scrolls,
All good deeds done unto the LORD,
And purity of virgin souls.

I bind unto myself today
The virtues of the star-lit heaven,
The glorious sun’s life-giving ray,
The whiteness of the moon at even,
The flashing of the lightning free,
The whirling winds’ tempestuous shocks,
The stable earth, the deep salt sea,
Around the old eternal rocks.

I bind unto myself today
The power of GOD to hold and lead,
His eye to watch, His might to stay,
His ear to hearken to my need;
The wisdom of my GOD to teach,
His hand to guide, His shield to ward,
The word of GOD to give me speech,
His heavenly host to be my guard.

Against the demons snares of sin,
The vice that gives temptation force,
The natural lusts that war within,
The hostile men that mar my course—
For few or many, far or nigh,
In every place, and in all hours,
Against their fierce hostility,
I bind to me these holy powers.

Against all Satan’s spells and wiles,
Against false words of heresy,
Against the knowledge that defiles,
Against the heart’s idolatry.
Against the wizard’s evil craft,
Against the death-wound and the burning shaft,
The choking wave, the poisoned dart,
Protect me, CHRIST, till Thy returning.
