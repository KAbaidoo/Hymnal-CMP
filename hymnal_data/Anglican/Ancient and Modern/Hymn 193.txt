HYMN 193

JESU, Lover of my soul,
Let me to Thy Bosom fly,
While the gathering waters roll, 
While the tempest still is high:
Hide me, O my Saviour, hide, 
Till the storm of life is past; 
Safe into the haven guide, 
O receive my soul at last.

Other refuge have I none;
Hangs my helpless soul on Thee;
Leave, ah! leave me not alone,
Still support and comfort me. 
All my trust on Thee is stayed,
All my help from Thee I bring;
Cover my defenseless head
With the shadow of Thy wing.

Plenteous grace with Thee is found,
Grace to cleanse from every sin;
Let the healing streams abound;
Make and keep me pure within;
Thou of Life the Fountain art;
Freely let me take of Thee;
Spring Thou up within my heart,
Rise to all eternity.
