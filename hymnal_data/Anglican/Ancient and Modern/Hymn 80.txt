HYMN 80

The people that in darkness
A glorious light have seen;
The light has shined on them who
In shades of death have been long
To hail Thee, sun of righteousness,
The gathering nations come;
They joy as when the reapers bear
Their harvest treasures home.

For Thou their burden dost remove,
And break Thy tyrant’s rod,
As in the day when Midian fell
Before the sword of GOD.

For unto us a Child is born,
To us a SON is given,
And on His shoulder ever rests
All power in earth and heaven.

His name shall be the prince of
The everlasting LORD, peace
The wonderful, the counselor,
The GOD by all adored.

His righteous government and
power Shall over all extend;
On judgment and on justice based,
His reign shall have no end.

LORD JESUS, reign in us, we pray,
And make us thine alone,
Who with the FATHER ever art
And Holy SPIRIT One.
