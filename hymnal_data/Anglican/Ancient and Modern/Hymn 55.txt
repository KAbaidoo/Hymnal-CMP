HYMN 55
CHRISTMAS

O Come, redeemer of mankind, appear,
Thee with full hearts the virgin-born
Let every age with rapt amazement hear
GOD is meet That wondrous birth which for our

Not by the will of man, or mortal seed
mysterious grace But by the SPIRIT’s breathed
The word of GOD became our flesh indeed,
race.

And grew a tender plant of human
Lo! Mary’s virgin womb its birth,
bears,
Nor less abides her virgin purity;
In the King’s glory see our nature
shares; to be, Here in His temple GOD vouchsafes

From His bright chamber, virtue’s holy shrine,
The royal bridegroom cometh to the day;
Divine, Of twofold substance, human and
As giant swift, rejoicing on His way,

Forth from His FATHER to the world
He goes, Back to the FATHER’s face His way
regains, Far down to souls beneath His glory
shows, Again at GOD’s right hand victorious
reigns.

With the eternal FATHER equal,
Thou Girt with our flesh dost triumph
evermore, below Strengthening our feeble bodies here
With endless grace from thine own living store.

How doth Thy lowly manger radiant shine!
on the sweet breath of night new splendor grows:
So may our SPIRITs glow with faith Divine,
interpose. Where no dark cloud of sin shall

All praise and glory to the FATHER be,
All praise and glory to His Only SON,
All praise and glory, HOLY GHOST, to Thee,
Both now, and while eternal ages run.
