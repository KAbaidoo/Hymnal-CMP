HYMN 515

FATHER, whatever of earthly bliss Thy sovereign will denies,
Accept at Thy Throne of grace
Let this petition rise:-

Give me a calm and thankful heart, From every murmur free;
The blessings of Thy grace impart, And let me live to Thee.

Let the sweet hope that Thou art My path of life attend;
Thy presence through my journey shine,
And crown my journey’s end.
