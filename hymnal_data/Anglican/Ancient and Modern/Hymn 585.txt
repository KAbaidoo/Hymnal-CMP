HYMN 585 Missions

O SPIRIT of the living GOD!
In all the fullness of Thy grace,
Where’er the foot of man hath trod, Descend on our apostate race.

Give tongues of fire and hearts of love
To preach the reconciling word;
Give power and unction from above,
Whenever the joyful sound is heard.

Be darkness, at Thy coming, light,
Confusion order in Thy path;
Souls without strength inspire with might;
Bid mercy triumph over wrath.

O SPIRIT of the LORD! prepare
All the round earth her GOD to meet;
Breathe Thou abroad like morning air,
Till hearts of stone begin to beat.

Baptize the nations; far and nigh
The triumphs of the cross record;
The Name of JESUS glorify
Till every kindred call Him LORD.
