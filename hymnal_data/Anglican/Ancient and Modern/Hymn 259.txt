HYMN 259

Thy Life was given for me,
Thy blood, O LORD, was shed,
That I might ransom'd be,
And quicken'd from the dead;
Thy life was given for me;
What have I given for Thee?

Long years were spent for me
In weariness and woe,
That through eternity
Thy glory I might know;
Long years were spent for me; Have I spent one for Thee?

Thy FATHER's Home of light,
Thy rainbow-circled Throne,
Were left for earthly night,
For wanderings sad and lone;
Yea, all was left for me;
Have I left aught for Thee?

Thou, LORD, hast borne for me More than my tongue can tell
Of bitterest agony,
To rescue me from hell;
Thou sufferedst all for me;
What have I borne for Thee?

And Thou hast brought to me
Down from Thy Home above
Salvation full and free
Thy pardon and Thy love,
Great gifts Thou broughtest me?
What have I brought to Thee?

O let my life be given,
My years for Thee be spent;
Would fetters all be riven,
And joy with suffering blent; Thou gav'st Thyself for me.
I give myself to Thee.
