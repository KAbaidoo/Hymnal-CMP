HYMN 391

Onward, Christian soldiers, Marching as to war,
With the cross of JESUS
Going on before,
CHRIST the Royal Master
Leads against the foe;
Forward into battle,
See, His banners go!

Onward, Christian soldiers, Marching as to war,
With the cross of JESUS
Going on before.

At the sign of triumph
Satan’s host doth flee;
On then, Christian soldiers, On to victory.
Hell’s foundations quiver At the shout of praise;
Brothers, lift your voices, Loud your anthems raise.
Onward, etc.

Like a mighty army
Moves the Church of God; Brothers, we are treading Where the Saints have trod; We
are not divided,
All one body we,
One in hope and doctrine, One in charity.
Onward, etc.

Crowns and Throne may perish Kingdoms rise and wane,
But the Church of JESUS
Constant will remain;
Gates of hell can never
‘Gainst that Church prevail; We have CHRIST’s own promise, And that cannot fail.
Onward, etc.

Onward, then, ye people,
Join our happy throng,
Blend with ours your voices In the triumph Song;
Glory, laud, and honour
Unto CHRIST the King,
This through countless ages Men and Angels sing. Onward, etc.
