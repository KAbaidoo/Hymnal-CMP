HYMN 735

GOD is working His purpose out as
year succeeds to year, GOD is working His purpose out and
the time is drawing near; Nearer and nearer draws the time,
the time that shall surely be, When the earth shall be filled with
the glory of GOD as the waters cover the sea.

From utmost east to utmost west
where’er man’s foot hath trod, By the mouth of many messengers
goes forth the voice of GOD, “Give ear to Me, ye continents, ye
Isles, give ear to Me, That the earth may be filled with
the glory of GOD as the waters cover the sea.”

What can we do to work GOD’s
work, to prosper and increase The brotherhood of all mankind,
the reign of the Prince of peace?
What can we do to hasten the time,
the time that shall surely be, When the earth shall be filled with
the glory of GOD as the waters cover the sea?

March we forth in the strength of
GOD with the banner of CHRIST
unfurled,
That the light of the glorious Gospel
of truth may shine throughout
the world
Fight we the fight with sorrow and
sin, to set their captives free, That the earth may be filled with the
glory of GOD as the waters cover the sea.

All we can do is nothing worth unless
GOD blesses the deed; Vainly we hope for the harvest-tide
till GOD gives life to the seed; Yet nearer and nearer draws the
time, the time that shall surely be, When the earth shall be filled with
the glory of GOD as the waters cover the sea.
