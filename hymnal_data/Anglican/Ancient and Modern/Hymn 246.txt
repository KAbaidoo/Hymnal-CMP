HYMN 246

What various hindrances we meet
In coming to the Mercy-seat;
Yet who that knows the worth of
prayer,
But wishes to be often there?

Prayer makes the darken’d cloud
withdraw,
Prayer climbs the ladder Jacob saw,
Gives exercise to faith and love,
Brings every blessing from above.

Restraining prayer, we cease to fight;
Prayer makes the Christian’s armour bright;
And Satan trembles when he sees
The weakest saint upon his knees.

When Moses stood with arms spread
wide,
Success was found on Israel’s side;
But when through weariness Thy
failed,
That moment Amalek prevailed.

Have we no words? ah, think again;
Words flow apace when we complain,
And fill our fellow-creature’s ear
With the sad tale
of all our care.

Were half the breath thus vainly
spent
To Heav’n in supplication sent.
Our cheerful Song would oftener be, “Hear what the LORD hath done
for me.”

O LORD, increase our faith and love,
That we may all Thy goodness prove
And gain from Thy exhaustless store
The fruits of prayer for evermore.
