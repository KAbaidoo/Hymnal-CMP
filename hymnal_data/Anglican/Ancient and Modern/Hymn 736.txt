HYMN 736

Let the Song go round the earth, JESUS CHRIST is LORD;
Sound His praises, tell His worth, Be His Name adored;
Every clime and every tongue
Join the grand, the glorious Song.

Let the Song go round the earth From the eastern sea,
Where the daylight has its birth, Glad, and bright, and free;
China’s millions join the strains, Waft them on to India’s plains.

Let the Song go round the earth!
Lands, where Islam’s sway
Darkly broods o’er home and hearth, Cast their bonds away;
Let His praise from Africa’s shore Rise and swell o'er wide lands o’er.

Let the Song go round the earth, Where the summer smiles;
Let the notes of holy mirth
Break from distant isles;
Inland forests, dark and dim,
Snow-bound coasts give back the hymn.

Let the Song go round the earth!
JESUS CHRIST is King!
With the story of His worth
Let the whole world ring;
Him creation all adore
Evermore and evermore.
