HYMN 639 Noon

Up to the Throne of GOD is borne
The voice of praise at early morn,
And He accepts the punctual hymn,
Sung as the light of day grows dim
Nor will He turn His ear aside
From holy offerings at noontide;
Then here to Him our souls we raise, In songs of gratitude and praise.

Blest are the moments, doubly blest, That, drawn from this one hour of
rest,
Are with a ready heart bestowed
Upon the service of our GOD,
Look up to heav’n th’ industrious
sun
Already half his race hath run;
He cannot halt, or go astray,
But our immortal SPIRITs may.

LORD, since his rising in the east
We have faltered or transgressed
Guide, from Thy love’s abundant
source,
What yet remains of this day’s course, Help with Thy grace, through life’s
short day,
Our upward and our downward way;
And glorify for us the west,
When we shall sink to final rest.
