HYMN 627

GOD made me for Himself, to serve
Him here
With love’s pure service and in
filial fear;
To show His praise, for Him to
labour now;
Then see His glory where the Angels bow

All needful grace was mine, through
His dear SON, Whose life and death my full
salvation won; The grace that would have
strengthened me, and taught; Grace that would crown me when
my work was wrought.

And I, poor sinner, cast it all away: Lived for the toil or pleasure of each day;
As if no CHRIST had shed His precious blood,
As if I owed no homage to my GOD.

O Holy SPIRIT, with Thy fire divine,
Melt into tears this thankless heart of mine;
Teach me to love what once I
seemed to hate,
And live to GOD, before it be too late.
