HYMN 568

Lamb of GOD, I look to Thee,
Thou shalt my example be;
Thou art gentle, meek, and mild, Thou wast once a little child.

Fain I would be as Thou art;
Give me Thy obedient heart;
Thou art pitiful and kind,
Let me have Thy loving mind.

Meek and lowly may I be;
Thou art all humility:
Let me to my betters bow,
Subject to Thy parents Thou.

Let me above all fulfill
GOD my Heavenly FATHER’s will;
Never His good SPIRIT grieve,
Only to His glory live.

Thou didst live to GOD alone,
Thou didst never seek thine own, Thou Thyself didst never please, GOD was all Thy happiness.

Loving JESU, gentle Lamb,
In Thy gracious hands I am;
Make me, SAVIOUR, what Thou art; Live Thyself within my heart.

I shall then show forth Thy praise, Serve Thee all my happy days;
Then the world shall always see
CHRIST, the Holy Child, in me.
