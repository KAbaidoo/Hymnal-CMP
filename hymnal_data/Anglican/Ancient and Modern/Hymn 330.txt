HYMN 330

I love to hear the story
Which angel voices tell,
How once the King of glory
Came down on earth to dwell.
I am both weak and sinful,
But this I surely know,
The Lord came down to save me, Because He loved me so.
I love to hear the story
Which angel voices tell,
How once the King of glory
Came down on earth to dwell.

I’m glad my Blessed Saviour
Was once a Child like me,
To show how pure and holy
His little ones might be;
And if I try to follow
His footsteps here below,
He never will forget me,
Because He loves me so,
I love to hear the story
Which angel voices tell,
How once the King of glory
Came down on earth to dwell.

To sing His love and mercy
My sweetest songs I’ll raise;
And Though I cannot see Him
I know He hears my praise;
For He has kindly promised
That even I may go
To sing among His angels,
Because He loves me so.
I love to hear the story
Which angel voices tell,
How once the King of glory
Came down on earth to dwell.
