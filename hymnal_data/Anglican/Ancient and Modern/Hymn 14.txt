HYMN 14

O TRINITY, most blessed Light, 
O United of primal Might, 
As now the fiery sun departs, 
Shed Thou Thy beams within our hearts

To Thee our morning Song of praise, 
To Thee our evening prayer we raise; 
Thee may our heart and voice adore 
For ever and for evermore.

Almighty FATHER, hear our cry 
Through JESUS CHRIST our LORD Most High, 
Who with the HOLY GHOST and Thee 
Doth live and reign eternally.
