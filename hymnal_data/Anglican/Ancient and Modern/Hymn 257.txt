HYMN 257

I heard the voice of JESUS say, “Come unto me and rest;
Lay down, Thou weary one, lay down Thy head upon my Breast;
I came to JESUS as I was,
Weary, and worn, and sad;
I found in Him a resting place, And He has made me glad.

I heard the voice of JESUS say, “Behold, I freely give
The living water, thirsty one,
Stoop down, and drink, and I drank Of that life-giving stream: [received, My thirst was quenched, my soul
And now I live in Him.

I heard the voice of JESUS say, “I am this dark world’s Light;
Look unto Me, Thy morn shall rise, And all Thy day be right:”
I looked to JESUS, and I found
In Him my Star, my sun;
And in that Light of life I’ll walk Till traveling days are done.
