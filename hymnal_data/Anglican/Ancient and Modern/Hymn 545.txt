HYMN 545

Glorious things of Thee are spoken, Zion, city of our GOD;
He whose word cannot be broken
Formed Thee for His own abode.
On the Rock of ages founded,
What can shake Thy sure repose?
With salvation’s walls surrounded, Thou may’st smile at all Thy foes.

See, the streams of living waters, Springing from eternal love,
Well supply Thy Sons and daughters, And all fear of want remove.
Who can faint while such a river
Ever flows their thirst to assuage; Grace, which like the LORD the Giver, Never fails
from age to age?

Round each habitation hovering,
See the cloud and fire appear,
For a glory and a covering—
Showing that the LORD is near.
Thus they march, the pillar leading, Light by night and shade by day;
Daily on the manna feeding they pray.

SAVIOUR, since of Zion’s city
I through grace, a member am,
Let the world deride or pity,
I will glory in Thy Name.

Fading is the world’s best pleasure, All its boasted pomp and show;
Solid joys and lasting treasure
None but Zion’s children know.
