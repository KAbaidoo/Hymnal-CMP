HYMN 724

Hosanna in the highest
To our exalted SAVIOR,
Who left behind For all mankind These tokens of His favor;
His bleeding love and mercy,
His all-redeeming passion,
Who here displays, And gives the grace Which brings us our salvation.

Louder than gathered waters,
Or bursting peals of thunder,
We lift our voice And speak our joys And shout our loving wonder.
Shout, all our elder brethren,
While we record the story
Of Him that came And suffered shame, To carry us to glory.

Angels in fixed amazement
Around our altars hover,
With eager gaze Adore the grace Of our Eternal Lover;
Himself and all His fullness,
Who gives to the believer;
And by this bread Whoever are fed Shall live with GOD forever.
