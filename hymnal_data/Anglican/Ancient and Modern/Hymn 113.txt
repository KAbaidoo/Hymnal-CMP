HYMN 113

See the destined day arise!
See, a willing Sacrifice,
JESUS, who but Thou had borne,
Lifted on that tree of scorn,
Every pang and bitter throe,
Finishing Thy life of woe?

Who but Thou had dared to drain,
Steeped in gall, the cup of pain,
And with tender body bear
Thorns, and nails, and piercing spear?

Thence the cleansing water flowed
Mingled from Thy side with blood;
Sign to all arresting eyes
Of the finished sacrifice.

Holy JESU, grant us grace
In that sacrifice to place
All our trust for life renewed,
Pardoned sin, and promised good.
