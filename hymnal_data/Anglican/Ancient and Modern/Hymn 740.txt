HYMN 740 Farewell Service

GOD be with you till we meet again;
By His counsels guide, uphold you,
With His sheep securely fold you;
GOD be with you till we meet again.

GOD be with you till we meet again;
‘Neath His wings protecting hide
you,
Daily manna still provide you;
GOD be with you till we meet again.

GOD be with you till we meet again;
When life’s perils thick confound
you
Put His arm unfailing round you;
GOD be with you till we meet again.

GOD be with you till we meet again:
Keep love’s banner floating o’er you.
Smite death’s threatening wave
before you:
GOD be with you till we meet again.
