HYMN 188

JESUS, meek and lowly,
SAVIOUR, pure and holy,
On Thy love relying
Hear me humbly crying

Prince of life and power,
My salvation’s tower,
On the cross I view Thee
Calling sinners to Thee.

There behold me gazing
At the sight amazing;
Bending low before Thee,
Helpless I adore Thee.

By Thy red wounds streaming, With Thy life-blood gleaming, Blood for sinners flowing,
Pardon free bestowing;

By that fount of blessing,
Thy dear love expressing,
All my aching sadness
Turn Thou into gladness.

LORD, in mercy guide me,
Be Thou e’er beside me;
In Thy ways direct me,
‘Neath Thy wings protect me.
