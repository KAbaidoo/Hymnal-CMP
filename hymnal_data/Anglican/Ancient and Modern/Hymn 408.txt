HYMN 408

Bishop of the souls of men,
When the foeman’s step is nigh,
When the wolf lays wait by night
For the lambs continually,
Watch, O LORD, about us keep,
Guard us, Shepherd of the sheep.

When the hireling flees away,
Caring only for his gold,
And the gate unguarded stands
At the entrance to the fold,
Stand, O LORD Thy flock before,
Thou the Guardian, Thou the Door.

LORD whose guiding finger ruled
In the casting of the lot,
That Thy Church might fill the
Throne of the lost Iscariot,
In our trouble ever thus
Stand, good Master, nigh to us.

When the saints their order take
In the New Jerusalem,
And Mathias stands elect,
Give us part and lot within him,
Where in thine own dwelling-place
We may witness face to face.

The Annunciation of the
Blessed Virgin Mary
