HYMN 434

Come pure hearts, in sweetest
measures
Sing of those who spread the treasures
In the holy Gospels shrined;
Blessed tidings of salvation,
Peace on earth, their proclamation,
Love from GOD to lost mankind.

See the Rivers four that gladden
With their streams the better Eden
Planted by our LORD most dear;
CHRIST the Fountain, these the
waters;
Drink, O Zion’s Sons and daughters,
Drink and find salvation here.

O that we Thy faith confession,
And Thy holy Word possessing,
JESU, may Thy love adore;
Unto Thee our voices raising,
Thee with all Thy ransom’d praising
Ever and for evermore.

The Hymn No.126, Parts 2 and 3, may be used on the Festivals of Apostles or
