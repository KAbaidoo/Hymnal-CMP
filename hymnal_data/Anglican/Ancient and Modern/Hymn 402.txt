HYMN 402 FOR A CHILD

Tender Shepherd, Thou hast stilled
Now Thy little lamb’s brief weeping; Oh, how peaceful, pale, and mild,
In its narrow bed ‘tis sleeping,
And no sigh of anguish sore
Heaves that little bosom more.

In a world of pain and care,
LORD, Thou wouldst no longer leave
To Thy meadows bright and fair; Lovingly Thou dost receive it;
Clothed in robes of spotless white
Now it dwells with Thee in light.

Ah, LORD JESU, grant that we
There may live where it is living,
And the blissful pastures see
That its heavenly food are giving;
Lost a while our treasured love,
Gained for ever, safe above.

St. Andrew the
