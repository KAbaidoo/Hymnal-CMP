HYMN 646

My sins have taken such a hold on me,
I am not able to look up to Thee;
LORD, I repent; accept my tears and grief:
But Thou hast taken all my sin away,
And I in Thee dare now look up and pray:
LORD, I believe: help Thou mine unbelief

Of nights unhallowed, and of sinful days,
Of careless thoughts and words and works and ways,
LORD, I repent: accept my tears and grief:
And in the life which Thou dost live within me
And the forgiveness which can all forgive,
LORD, I believe; help Thou mine unbelief.

Of selfishness which makes the soul unjust,
Envy and strife and every sinful lust
LORD, I repent; accept my tears and grief:
And in the blood, which doth my pardon plead,
The truth and love, which for me intercede,
LORD, I believe; help Thou mine unbelief.

Of sins that as a cloud have hid Thy face,
Of Thy cares slighted, and Thy grace,
LORD, I repent; accept my tears and grief;
In Love, that puts sin’s envious veil aside,
Rending the veil of flesh which for me died,
LORD, I believe; help Thou mine unbelief.

For sin I mourn, that sin that gave Thee pain:
Thine was the burden, mine alone the stain;
LORD, I repent; accept my tears and grief:
CHRIST is my joy; and out of all distress
He doth deliver with His righteousness
LORD, I believe; help Thou mine unbelief.
