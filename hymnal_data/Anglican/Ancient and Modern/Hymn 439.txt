HYMN 439

The SON of GOD goes forth to war, A Kingly crown to gain;
His blood-red banner streams afar!
Who follows in His train?
Who best can drink his cup of woe, Triumphant over pain,
Who patient bears his cross below, He follows in His train.

The Martyrs first, whose eagle eye Could pierce beyond the grave; Who saw his Master
in the sky, And called on Him to save, [tongue Like Him, with pardon on his
In midst of mortal pain, [wrong; He prayed for them that did the Who follows in his train?

A glorious band, the chosen few On whom the SPIRIT came,
Twelve valiant saints, their hope they knew.
And mocked the cross and flame, They met the tyrant’s brandished steel,
The lion’s gory mane, [to feel; They bow their necks, the death Who follows in their
train?

A noble army, men and boys,
The matron and the maid.
Around the SAVIOUR’s Throne rejoice In robes of light arrayed.
They climbed the steep ascent of Heav’n
Through peril, toil, and pain; O GOD, to us may grace be given To follow in their train.
