HYMN 15

Before the ending of the day,
Creator of the world, we pray
That Thou with wonted love wouldst keep
Thy watch around us while we sleep.

O let no evil dreams be near,
Nor phantoms of the night appear;
Our ghostly enemy restrain,
Lest aught of sin our bodies stain.

Almighty FATHER, hear our cry
Through JESUS CHRIST our LORD Most High,
Who with the HOLY GHOST and Thee
Doth live and reign eternally.
