HYMN 421

Praise to GOD who reigns above,
Binding earth and Heav’n in love;
All the armies of the sky
Worship His dread sovereignty.

Seraphim His praises sing,
Cherubim on fourfold wing,
Thrones, Dominions, Princes, powers Marchal’d might that never cowers.

Speeds the Archangel from His Face, Bearing messages of grace;
Angel hosts His words fulfil,
Ruling nature by His Will.

Yet on man they joy to wait,
All that bright celestial state,
For in Man their LORD they see
CHRIST, the Incarnate Deity.

On the Throne their LORD who died
Sits in Manhood glorified;
Where His people faint below
Angels count it joy to go.

Oh, the depths of joy Divine
Thrilling through those orders nine, When the lost are found again,
When the banished come to reign!

Now in faith, in hope, in love,
We will join the choirs above,
Praising, with the heavenly Host,
FATHER, SON, and HOLY GHOST.
