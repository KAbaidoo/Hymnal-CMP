HYMN 393

Rejoice, ye pure in heart,
Rejoice, give thanks, and sing;
Your festal banner wave on high,
The Cross of CHRIST your King.

Bright youth and snow-crown’d age, Strong men and maidens meek,
Raise high your free exulting Song, GOD’s wondrous praises speak.

Yes onward, onward still,
With hymn, and chant, and Song,
Through gate, and porch, and column’d aisle,
The hallowed pathways throng.

With all the Angel choirs,
With all the saints on earth,
Pour out the strains of joy and bliss, True rapture, noblest mirth.

Your clear Hosannas raise,
And Alleluias loud; float, Whilst answering echoes upward
Like wreaths of incense cloud.

With voice as full and strong
As ocean’s surging praise, Send forth the hymns our FATHERs
The psalms of ancient days.

Yes on, through life’s long path, Still chanting as ye go,
From youth to age, by night and day, In gladness and in woe.

Still lift your standard high,
Still march in firm array, [toil As warrior through the darkness
Til dawn the golden day.

Then on, ye pure in heart,
Rejoice, give thanks, and sing;
Your festal banner wave on high,
The cross of CHRIST your King.

Praise Him who reigns on high,
The LORD whom we adore,
The FATHER, SON, and HOLY GHOST,
One GOD forevermore.
