HYMN 540

Fight the good fight with all Thy might,
CHRIST is Thy strength, and CHRIST
Thy Right;
Lay hold on life, and it shall be Thy joy and crown eternally.

Run the straight race through GOD’s good grace,
Lift up thine eyes, and seek His Face;
Life with its way before thee lies, CHRIST is the path, and CHRIST the prize.

Cast care aside, lean on Thy Guide: His boundless mercy will provide; Trust, and Thy
trusting soul shall prove love, CHRIST is its life, and CHRIST its.

Faint not nor fear, His arms are near,
He changeth not, and Thou art dear Only believe, and Thou shalt see That CHRIST is all
in all to Thee.
