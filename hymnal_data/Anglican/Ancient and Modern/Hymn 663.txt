For the beauty of the earth
For the beauty of the skies,
For the love which from our birth Over and around us lies,

This our grateful hymn of praise.

For the beauty of each hour
Of the day and of the night,
Hill and vale, and tree and flower, Sun and moon and stars of light,
LORD of all, to Thee we raise
This our grateful hymn of praise.

For the joy of human love,
Brother, sister, parents, child,
Friends on earth, and friends above, Pleasures pure and undefiled,
LORD of all, to Thee we raise
This our grateful hymn of praise.

For each perfect gift of thine,
To our race so
