HYMN 527

COME, my soul, thy suit prepare,
JESUS loves to answer prayer;
He Himself has bid thee pray,
Therefore will not say thee nay.

Thou art coming to a King,
Large petitions with Thee bring;
For His grace and power are such,
None can ever ask too much.

With my burden I begin;
LORD, remove this load of sin;
Let Thy Blood, for sinners spilt,
Set my conscience free from guilt.

LORD, I come to Thee for rest;
Take possession of my breast;
There Thy blood-bought right maintain,
And without a rival reign.

While I am a pilgrim here,
Let Thy love my spirit cheer;
Be my Guide, my Guard, my Friend,
Lead me to my journey’s end.
