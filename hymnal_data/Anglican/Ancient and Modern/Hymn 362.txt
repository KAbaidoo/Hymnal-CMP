HYMN 362

LORD, her watch Thy Church is
keeping;
When shall earth Thy rule obey?
When shall end the night of weeping?
When shall break the promised day?
See the whitening harvest languish,
Waiting still the laborers’ toil;
Was it vain, Thy SON’s deep anguish,
Shall the strong retain the spoil?

Tidings, sent to every creature,
Millions yet have never heard;
Can they hear without a preacher?
LORD, Almighty, give the Word:

Give the Word: in every nation
Let the Gospel trumpet sound,
Witnessing a world’s salvation
To the earth’s remotest bound.

Then the end: Thy Church complete,
All Thy chosen gathered in,
With their King in glory seated,
Satan bound, and banished sin;
Gone forever parting, weeping,
Hunger, sorrow, death, and pain;
Lo! her watch Thy Church is keeping;
Come, LORD JESUS, come to reign.
