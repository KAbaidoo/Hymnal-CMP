HYMN 483

From east to west from shore to
shore,
Let every heart awake and sing
The Holy Child whom Mary bore,
To CHRIST, the everlasting King.

Behold! the world’s Creator wears
The form and fashion of a slave;
Our very flesh our maker shares,
His fallen creature, man, to save.

For this how wondrously He wrought!
A maiden, in her lowly place,
Became, in ways beyond all thought,
The chosen vessel of His grace.

She bowed her to the Angel’s word
Declaring what the FATHER willed.

He shrank not from the oxen’s stall, He lay within the manger bed,
And He whose bounty feedeth all,
At Mary’s breast Himself was fed.

And while the Angels in the sky
Sang praise above the silent field,
To shepherds poor the LORD Most
High,
The one great shepherd, was revealed.

All glory for this blessed morn
To GOD the FATHER ever be;
All praise to Thee, O Virgin-born
All praise O HOLY GHOST, to Thee.
