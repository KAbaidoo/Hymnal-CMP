HYMN 236

Jerusalem, my happy home,
Name ever dear to me,
When shall my labors have an end?
Thy joys when shall I see?

When shall these eyes Thy heaven-built walls
And pearly gates behold?
Thy bulwarks with salvation strong,
And streets of shining gold?

Apostles, Martyrs, Prophets there
Around my SAVIOR stand;
And all I love in CHRIST below
Will join the glorious band.

Jerusalem, my happy home,
When shall I come to Thee?
When shall my labors have an end?
Thy joys when shall I see?

O CHRIST, do Thou my soul prepare
For that bright home of love;
That I may see Thee and adore,
With all Thy Saints above.
