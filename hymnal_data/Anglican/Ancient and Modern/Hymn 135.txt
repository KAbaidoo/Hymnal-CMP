HYMN 135

Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
The strife is o’er, the battle done;
Now is the Victor’s triumph won;
O let the song of praise be sung.
Hallelujah!

Death’s mightiest powers have done their worst, And JESUS hath His foes dispersed;
Let shouts of praise and joy outburst Hallelujah!

On the third morn He rose again
Glorious in majesty to reign;
O let us swell the joyful strain.
Hallelujah!

LORD, by the stripes which wounded Thee From death’s dread sting Thy servants free,
That we may live and sing to Thee
Hallelujah!
