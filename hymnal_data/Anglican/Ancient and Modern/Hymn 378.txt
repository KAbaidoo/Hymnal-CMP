HYMN 378 Thanksgiving

Rejoice today with one accord,
Sing out with exultation:
Rejoice and praise our mighty LORD, Whose arm hath brought salvation; His works of
love proclaim
The greatness of His Name;
For He is GOD alone
Who hath His mercy shown;
Let all His saints adore Him!

When in distress to Him we cried, He heard our sad complaining:
O trust in Him, whate’er betide,
His love is all-sustaining;
Triumphant songs of praise
To Him our hearts shall raise;
Now every voice shall say,
“O praise our GOD alway”;
Let all His saints adore Him!

Rejoice today with one accord,
Sing out with exultation;
Rejoice and praise our mighty LORD, Whose arm hath brought salvation; His works of
love proclaim
The greatness of His Name;
For He is GOD alone
Who hath His mercy shown;
Let all His saints adore Him!
