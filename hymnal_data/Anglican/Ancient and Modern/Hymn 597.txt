HYMN 597

As near the wish’d for port we draw
We lift our hearts in praise to Thee,
Almighty FATHER, loving LORD,
Our Pilot on the troubled sea.

By the good care in peace we come,
From fire and tempest securely kept,
And after tempest, at Thy word,
The waves have laid them down and slept.

As Thou hast given us outward calm,
No, LORD, within us may there be
A peace Divine, a peace in Him,
Through whom alone we live to Thee,

Give us more light, direct our course,
Cleanse us from guile, our hearts renew;
Let not dark clouds of sin shut out
The Star of JESUS from our view.

And then, our long life voyage o’er,
And past the perils of the sea,
Receive us on the blissful shore,
To everlasting rest with Thee.

To FATHER, SON, and HOLY GHOST,
The GOD whom Heav’n and earth adore,
Be glory as it was of old,
Is now, and shall be evermore.
