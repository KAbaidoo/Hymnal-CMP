HYMN 636

FATHER, SON, and HOLY GHOST,
One in Three, and THREE in ONE
As by the celestial host
Let Thy will on earth be done
Praise by all to Thee be given
Glorious LORD of earth and Heav’n
If a sinner such as I
May to Thy great glory live,
All my actions sanctify
All my words and thoughts receive; Claim me for Thy service, claim
All I have, and all I am.

Take my soul and body’s powers;
Take my memory, mind, and will,
All my goods, and all my hours,
All I know, and all I feel
All I think, or speak, or do; Take my heart:- but make it new!

O my GOD, thine own I am,
Let me give Thee back thine own; Freedom, friends, and health, and fame, Consecrate to Thee alone; Thine to live, thrice happy I;
Happier still if thine I die,

FATHER, SON, and HOLY GHOST,
One in Three, and THREE in ONE,
As by the celestial host,
Praise by all to Thee be given,
Glorious LORD of earth and Heav’n.
