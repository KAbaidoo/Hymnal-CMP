HYMN 154

When GOD of old came down from
Heav’n
In power and wrath He came;
Before His feet the clouds were riven, Half darkness and half flame;

But, when He came the second time He came in power and Love;
Softer than gale at morning prime Hover’d His holy Dove.

The fires, that rush’d on Sinai down In sudden torrents dread,
Now gently light, a glorious crown, On every sainted head.

And as on Israel’s awe-struck ear The voice exceeding loud
The trump, that Angels quake to hear, Thrilled from the deep, dark cloud;
So, when the SPIRIT of our GOD
Came down His flock to find,
A Voice from Heav’n was heard abroad, A rushing, mighty wind.

It fills the Church of GOD; it fills The sinful world around;
Only in stubborn hearts and wills No place for it is found.

Come, LORD, come Wisdom, Love, and Power Open our ears to hear;
Let us not miss the accepted hour; Save, LORD, by love or fear.
