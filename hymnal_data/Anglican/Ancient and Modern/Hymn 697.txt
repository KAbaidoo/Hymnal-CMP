HYMN 697

Rise in the strength of GOD,
And face life’s uphill way,
The steps which other feet have trod You tread today.

Press onward, upward still,
To win your way at last,
With better hope and stronger will
Than in the past,-

Life’s work more nobly wrought,
Life’s race more bravely run,
Life’s daily conflict faced and fought, Life’s duty done.
