HYMN 452 FOR A BISHOP

O Thou whose all-redeeming might
Crowns every chief in faith's true fight,
On this commemoration day
Hear us, good JESU, while……………….

In faithful strife for Thy dear name Thy servant earned the saintly fame,
Which pious hearts with praise revere
In constant memory year by year.

Earth's fleeting joys he counted nought,
For higher, truer joys he sought
And now, with Angels round Thy Throne,
Unfading treasures are his own.

O grant that we, most gracious GOD, May follow in the steps he trod;
And, freed from every stain of sin, As he hath won may also win.

To Thee, O CHRIST, our loving King, All glory, praise, and thanks we bring;
Whom with the FATHER we adore
And HOLY GHOST for evermore.
