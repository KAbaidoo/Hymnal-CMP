HYMN 206

That day of wrath, that dreadful
day, When heaven and earth shall pass
What power shall be the sinner’s stay?
How shall he meet that dreadful day?

When, shriveling like a parched
scroll,
The flaming heavens together roll,
When louder yet, and yet more
Dread, Swells the high trump that wakes
the dead;
Oh, on that day, that wrathful day,
When man to judgment wakes from
clay, Be Thou, O CHRIST, the sinner’s
Though heaven and earth shall pass
away.
