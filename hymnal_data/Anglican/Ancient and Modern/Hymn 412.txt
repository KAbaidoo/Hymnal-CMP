HYMN 412

Brightly did the light divine
From his words and actions shine, Whom the Twelve, with love un-
blamed,
"SON of consolation" named.

Full of peace and lively joy
Sped he on his high employ,
By his mild exhorting word
Adding many to the LORD.

Blessed SPIRIT, Who didst call
Barnabas and holy Paul,
And didst them with gifts endue,
Mighty words and wisdom true,

Grant us, LORD of life, to be
By their pattern full of Thee;
That beside them we may stand
In that day on CHRIST's right Hand.
