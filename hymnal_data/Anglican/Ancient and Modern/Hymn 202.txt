HYMN 202

REJOICE, the LORD is King,
Your LORD and King adore;
Mortals, give thanks and sing,
And triumph evermore:
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice; Rejoice, again I say, rejoice

JESUS, the Saviour, reigns,
The GOD of truth and love:
When He had purged our stains,
He took His seat above:
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice; Rejoice, again I say, rejoice.

His Kingdom cannot fail;
He rules o’er earth and Heav’n;
The keys of death and hell
Are to our JESUS given:
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice; Rejoice, again I say, rejoice.

He sits at GOD’s right hand
Till all His foes submit,
And bow to His command,
And fall beneath His feet:
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice; Rejoice, again I say, rejoice.
