HYMN 610 FOR A CHILD

Safely, safely gathered in,
Far from sorrow, far from sin,
No more childish griefs or fears,
No more sadness, no more tears;
For the life so young and fair
Now hath passed from earthly care;
GOD Himself the soul will keep,
Giving His beloved -- sleep.

Safely, safely gathered in,
Far from sorrow, far from sin,
Passed beyond all grief and pain
Death for Thee is truest gain;

For our loss we must not weep,
Nor our loved one long to keep
From the home of rest and peace
Where all sin and sorrow cease.

Safely, safely gathered in,
Far from sorrow, far from sin;
GOD has saved from weary strife,
In its dawn, this fresh young life;
Now it waits for us above,
Resting in the SAVIOUR’s love;
JESU, grant that we may meet
There, adoring at Thy feet.
