HYMN 304

Crown Him with many crowns,
The Lamb upon His Throne;
Hark! How the heavenly anthem
All music but its own; drowns Awake, my soul, and sing
Of Him who died for Thee, King And hail Him as Thy matchless
Through all eternity.

Crown Him the Virgin’s SON,
The GOD incarnate born, won Whose arm those crimson trophies Which now His Brow adore
Fruit of the mystic Rose,
As of that Rose the Stem;
The root whence mercy ever flows The Babe of Bethlehem.

Crown Him the LORD of love
Behold His Hands and Side,
Those Wounds yet visible above In beauty glorified:
No Angel in the sky
Can fully ear that sight, eye But downward bends his burning At mysteries so bright.

Crown Him the LORD of peace,
Whose power a scepter sways
From pole to pole, that wars may cease, And all be prayer and praise
His reign shall know no end,
And round His pierced feet
Fair flowers of Paradise extend Their fragrance ever sweet.

Crown Him the LORD of years,
The Potentate of time,
Creator of the rolling spheres, Ineffably sublime:
All hail, Redeemer, hail!
For Thou hast died for me;
Thy praise shall never, never fall Throughout eternity.
