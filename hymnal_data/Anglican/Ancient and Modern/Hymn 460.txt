HYMN 460 OUR LORD

In days of old on Sinai
The LORD Almighty came
In majesty of terror,
In thunder-cloud and flame:
On Tabor, with the glory
Of sunniest light possessed,
The excellence of beauty
In JESUS was expressed.

All light created paled there, And did Him worship meet;
The sun itself adored Him,
And bowed before His feet;

While Moses and Elias,
Upon the Holy Mount,
The co-eternal glory
Of CHRIST our GOD recount.

O holy, wondrous vision!
But what when, this life past, The beauty of Mount Tabor
Shall end in Heav’n at last?
But what when all the glory
Of uncreated light
Shall be the promised guerdon Of them that win the fight?
