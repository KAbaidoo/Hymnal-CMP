HYMN 638

O GOD, to know that Thou art just Gives hope and peace within;
We could not in a mercy trust
Which takes no count of sin.

If I would open to Thy sight My utmost wickedness;
See, LORD, in Thy most searching light What I have done amiss.

No stern and needless law was thine-Hard to be understood—
But plainly read in every line, Holy, and just, and good.

Thou basely weak my fallen race, And masterful my foes,
I had th’ omnipotence of grace To conquer, if I chose.

Well did I know the tender Heart I outraged by my sin,
Yet with the world I would not part, Nor rein my passions in.

My fault it was, O LORD Most High And not my fate alone:
Thou canst not suffer sin, nor I In any way atone.

Yet there’s a plea that I may trust-CHRIST died that I might live!
Cleanse me, my GOD, for Thou art just Be faithful, and forgive.
