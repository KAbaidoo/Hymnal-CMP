HYMN 142 Rogation Days

To Thee our GOD we fly
For mercy and for grace;
O hear our lowly cry
And hide not Thou Thy face,
O LORD, stretch forth Thy mighty Hand
And guard and bless our FATHER—
Arise, O LORD of hosts!
Be jealous of Thy Name,
And drive from out our coasts
The sins that put to shame.
O LORD, stretch forth Thy mighty Hand
And guard and bless our FATHER—
Thy best gifts from on high
In rich abundance pour,
That we may magnify
And praise Thee more and more,
O LORD, stretch forth Thy mighty Hand,
And guard and bless our FATHER—
The powers ordained by Thee
With heavenly wisdom bless;
May they Thy servants be,
And rule in righteousness.
O LORD, stretch forth Thy mighty Hand,
And guard and bless our FATHER—
The church of Thy dear SON
Inflame with love’s pure fire,
Bind her once more in one,
And life and truth inspire.
O LORD, stretch forth Thy mighty Hand,
And guard and bless our FATHER—
The pastors of Thy fold
With grace and power endue,
That faithful, pure, and bold,
They may be pastors true.
O LORD, stretch forth Thy mighty Hand,
And guard and bless our FATHER—
O let us love Thy house,
And sanctify Thy day,
Bring unto Thee our vows,
And loyal homage pay.
O LORD, stretch forth Thy mighty Hand,
And guard and bless our FATHER—
Give peace, LORD, in our time;
O let no foe draw nigh,
Nor lawless deed of crime,
Insult Thy Majesty.
O LORD, stretch forth Thy mighty Hand,
And guard and bless our FATHER—
Though vile and worthless, still Thy people, LORD, are we;
And for our GOD we will
None other have but Thee.
O LORD, stretch forth Thy mighty Hand,
And guard and bless our FATHER—
