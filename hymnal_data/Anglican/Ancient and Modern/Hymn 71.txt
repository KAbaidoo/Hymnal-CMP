HYMN 71

O blessed day, when first was poured
The blood of our redeeming LORD!
O blessed day, when first began
His sufferings borne for sinful man!

Scarce entered on this life of woe
His infant blood begins to flow:
A foretaste of His death. He feels,
An earnest of His love reveals.

From Heaven descending to fulfill
The bidding of His FATHER’s will,
A victim even now He lies
Before the day of sacrifice.

For love of us His woes begin;
The sinless suffers for our sin;
The Law’s great maker for our aid
Obedient to the Law is made.

The wound He through the Law
endures
Our freedom from that Law secures;
Henceforth a holier law prevails,
The law of love which never fails.

LORD, circumcise our hearts, we pray,
And take what is not thine away;
Write thine own name within our hearts
Thy law upon our inmost parts.

O LORD, the Virgin-born, to Thee
Eternal praise and glory be,
Whom with the FATHER we adore
And HOLY GHOST for evermore.
