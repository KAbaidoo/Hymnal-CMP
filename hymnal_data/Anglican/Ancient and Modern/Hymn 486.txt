HYMN 486 Epiphany

The FATHER’s sole-begotten SON
Was born, the Virgin’s Child, on
earth;
His cross for us adoption won, -
The life and grace of second birth.

Forth from the height of Heav’n He came,
In form of man with man abode;
Redeemed His world from death and shame,
The joys of endless life bestowed.

Redeemer, come with power benign, Dwell in the souls that look for Thee; O Let Thy
light within us shine
That we may Thy salvation see.

Abide with us, O LORD, we pray,
Dispel the gloom of doubt and woe; Wash every stain of guilt away,
Thy tender healing grace bestow.

LORD, Thou hast come, and well we know
That Thou wilt likewise come again; Thy Kingdom shield from every foe, Thy honor
and Thy rule maintain.

Eternal glory, LORD, to Thee,
Whom, now revealed, our hearts
adore;
To GOD the FATHER glory be,
And Holy SPIRIT evermore.
