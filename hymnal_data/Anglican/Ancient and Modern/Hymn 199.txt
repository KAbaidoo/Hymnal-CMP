HYMN 199

Thou art the Way: by Thee alone
From sin and death we flee:
And he who would the FATHER seek
Must seek Him, LORD, by Thee.

Thou art the Truth; Thy word alone
True wisdom can impart;
Thou only canst inform the mind,
And purify the heart

Thou art the Life; the rending tomb
Proclaims Thy conquering arm:
And those who put their trust in Thee
Nor death nor hell shall harm.

Thou art the Way, the Truth, the Life,
Grant us that Way to know,
That truth to keep, that life to win,
Whose joys eternal flow.
