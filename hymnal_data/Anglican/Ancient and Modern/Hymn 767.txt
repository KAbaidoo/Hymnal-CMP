HYMN 767

Righteous FATHER, we have
wronged Thee,
Underfoot Thy laws have cast;
Now we fain would serve Thee better, O forgive us what is past.

Loving JESUS, we have hurt Thee, Yielded to temptation’s blast:
Now we long to stand more firmly, O forgive us what is past.

Holy SPIRIT, we have grieved Thee.
Sin and death have held us fast:
Now we yearn for Life and Freedom.
O forgive us what is past.

FATHER, SON, and Holy SPIRIT
GOD eternal, First and Last,
Penitent we kneel before Thee
O forgive us all the past.
