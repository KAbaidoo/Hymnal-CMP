HYMN 297

Songs of praise the Angels sang, Heav’n with Alleluias rang.
When creation was begun,
When GOD spoke and it was done.

Songs of praise awoke the morn
When the Prince of peace was born: songs of praise arose when He
Captive led captivity.

Heav’n and earth must pass away, songs of praise shall crown that day; GOD will make
new heavens and earth, songs of praise shall hail their birth.

And will man alone be dumb
Til that glorious kingdom come?
No, the Church delights to raise Psalms and hymns and songs of
praise.
Saints below with heart and voice, Still in songs of praise rejoice; Learning here, by faith
and love, songs of praise to sing above.

Hymns of glory, songs of praise, FATHER, unto Thee we raise,
JESU, glory unto Thee
With the SPIRIT, ever be.
