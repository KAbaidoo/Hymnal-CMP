HYMN 125: Easter

Ye choirs of new Jerusalem,
Your sweetest notes employ,
The Paschal victory to hymn
In strains of holy joy.

For Judah’s Lion bursts His chains, Crushing the serpent’s head;
And cries aloud through death’s domains To wake the imprisoned dead.

Devouring depths of hell their prey At His command restore;
His ransomed hosts pursue their way Where JESUS goes before.

Triumphant in His glory now
To Him all power is given;
To Him in one communion bow
All saints in earth and Heav’n.

While we, His soldiers, praise our King His mercy we implore,
Within His palace bright to bring And keep us evermore.

All glory to the FATHER be,
All glory to the SON,
All glory, HOLY GHOST, to Thee, While endless ages run.
Alleluia!
