HYMN 387

LORD of the harvest, once again
We thank Thee for the ripened grain;
For crops safe carried, sent to cheer Thy servants through another year;
For all sweet holy thoughts supplied
By seed-time, and by harvest-tide.
The bare dead grain, in autumn sown,
its robe of vernal green puts on;
Glad from its wintry grave it springs, fresh garnished by the King of kings;
So, LORD, to those who sleep in Thee
Shall new and glorious bodies be.

Nor vainly of Thy Word we ask
A lesson from the reaper's task;
So shall Thine Angels issue forth;
The tares be burnt; the just of earth, to wind and storm exposed no more,
Be gathered to their FATHER's store,
Daily, O LORD, our prayers be said,
As Thou hast taught, for daily bread; But not alone our bodies feed,
Supply our fainting spirits' need;
O bread of life, from day to day,
Be Thou their comfort, food, and stay.
