HYMN 765

Today Thy mercy calls us
To wash away our sin,
However great our trespass
Whatever we have been;
However long from mercy
Our hearts have turned away,
The precious Blood can cleanse us, And make us white today.

Today Thy gate is open,
And all who enter in
Shall find a Father's welcome, And pardon for their sin.
The past shall be forgotten,
A present joy be given,
A future grace be promised,
A glorious crown in heaven.

Today our Father calls us,
His Holy Spirit waits;
His blessed Angels gather
Around the heavenly gates;
No question will be asked us
How often we have come;
Although we often have wandered, It is our Father's home!

O all-embracing mercy!
O ever-open door!
What should we do without Thee When heart and eye run o'er?
When all things seem against us To drive us to despair,
We know one gate is open,
One ear will hear our prayer!
