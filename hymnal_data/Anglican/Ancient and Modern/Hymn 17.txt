HYMN 17

The sun is sinking fast, 
The daylight dies; 
Let love awake, and pay 
Her evening sacrifice.

As CHRIST upon the Cross His Head inclined, 
And to His FATHER’s hands His parting Soul resigned;
So now herself my soul
Would wholly give Into His sacred charge,

In Whom all SPIRITS live; 
So now beneath His eye; 
Would calmly rest, 
Without a wish or Thought Abiding in the breast.

Save that His Will be done, 
Whatever betide, 
Dead to herself, 
and dead In Him to all beside.

Thus would I live;
yet now Not I, but He 
In all His power and love 
Henceforth alive in me.

ONE Sacred TRINITY! 
ONE LORD Divine! 
May I be ever His, 
And He for ever mine.
