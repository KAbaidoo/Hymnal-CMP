HYMN 499

On the resurrection morning
Soul and body meet again;
No more sorrow, no more weeping,
no more pain!

Here awhile they must be parted,
And the flesh its Sabbath keep,
Waiting in a holy stillness
wrapped in sleep.

For a while the tired body
Lies with feet toward the morn;
Til the last and brightest Easter day be born.

But the soul in contemplation
Utters earnest prayer and strong,
Bursting at the resurrection
into Song.

Soul and body reunited
Thenceforth nothing shall divide,
Waking up in CHRIST’s own likeness satisfied.

Oh! the beauty, Oh! the gladness
Of that resurrection day,
Which shall not through endless ages pass away!

On that happy Easter morning
All the graves their dead restore; FATHER, sister, child and mother,
meet once more,
To that brightest of all meetings
Bring us, JESU CHRIST, at last;
By Thy cross, through death and
holding fast. [judgment.
