HYMN 168

There is a book, who runs may read, Which heavenly truth imparts,
And all the lore its scholars need, Pure eyes and Christian hearts.

The works of GOD above, below,
Within us and around,
Are pages in that book, to show
How GOD Himself is found.

The glorious sky, embracing all,
is like the maker’s love,
Wherewith encompassed great and
In peace and order move. [small,
The Moon above, the Church below,
A wondrous race they run;
But all their radiance, all their glow, Each borrows of its Sun.

The SAVIOUR lends the light and heat That crown His holy hill;
The Saints like stars, around His seat Perform their courses still.

The dew of heaven is like Thy grace, It steals in silence down;
But where it lights, the favored place
By richest fruits is known.

One Name, above all glorious names, With its ten Thousand tongues
The everlasting sea proclaims,
Echoing Angelic songs.

The raging fire, the roaring wind
Thy boundless power display;
But in the gentler breeze we find
Thy SPIRIT’s viewless way.

Two worlds are ours: ‘tis only sin Forbids us to descry
The mystic Heaven and earth within, Plain as the sea and sky,

Thou, who hast given me eyes to see And love this sight so fair,
Give me a heart to find out Thee,
And read Thee everywhere.
