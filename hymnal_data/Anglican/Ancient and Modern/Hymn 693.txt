HYMN 693

Eternal GOD, we look to Thee,
To Thee for help we fly;
Thine eye alone our wants can see, Thy hand alone supply.

LORD, let Thy fear within us dwell, Thy love our footsteps guide:
That love will all vain love expel; That fear, all fear beside.

Not what we wish, but what we want, O let Thy grace supply;
The good, unasked, in mercy grant; The ill, Though asked, deny.
