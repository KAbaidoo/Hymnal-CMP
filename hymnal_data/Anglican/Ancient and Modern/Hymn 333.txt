HYMN 333

CHRIST, who once amongst us As a Child did dwell,
Is the children’s SAVIOR
And He loves us well;
If we keep our promise
Made Him at the Font,
He will be our shepherd,
And we shall not want.

There it was they laid us
In those tender Arms,
Where the lambs are carried Safe from all alarms;
If we trust His promise,
He will let us rest
In his Arms forever,
Leaning on His Breast.

Though we may not see Him
For a little while,
We shall know He holds us, Often feel His smile;
Death will be to slumber
In that sweet embrace,
And we shall awaken
To behold His Face.

He will be our Shepherd
After as before,
By still heavenly waters
Lead us evermore,
Make us lie in pastures
Beautiful and green
Where none thirst or hunger, And no tears are seen.

JESUS, our good shepherd,
Laying down Thy life,
Lest Thy sheep should perish In the cruel strife.

Help us to remember
All Thy love and care,
Trust in Thee, and love Thee Always, everywhere.
