HYMN 497 Easter

“Welcome, happy morning!”
to ages shall say;
Hell today is vanquished! Heav’n
is won today!
Lo! the dead is living, GOD for
Him, their creator, all His
works adore;
“welcome, happy morning!” age

Earth with joy confesses, clothing her for spring,
All good gifts return with her return
Bloom in every meadow, leaves on
every bough,
speak His sorrows ended, hail His triumph now
Hell today is vanquished! Heav’n
is won today!

Months in due succession, days of
lengthening light,
Hours and passing moments praise
Thee in their flight;
Brightness of the morning, sky and fields and sea,
praise to Thee: Vanquisher of
darkness, bring their “Welcome, happy morning!” age
to ages shall say.

Maker and Redeemer, life and
Health of all,
Thou from Heav’n beholding man’s
SON, Manhood to deliver, manhood didst put on:
Hell today is vanquished! Heav’n is won today!

Thou, of life the Author, death didst undergo,
Tread the path of darkness, saving strength to show;
Come then, true and faithful, now
fulfill Thy word;
“Tis thine own third morning! rise O buried LORD!
“Welcome, happy morning!” age

Loose the souls long prisoned, bound with Satan’s chain;
All that now is fallen raise to life
Show Thy face in brightness, bid
the nations see!
Bring again our daylight: day returns
Hell today is vanquished! Heav’n is won today!
