HYMN 547

Children of the Heavenly King,
As ye journey, sweetly sing;
Sing your SAVIOR’s worthy praise, Glorious in His works and ways.

We are traveling home to GOD
In the way the Fathers trod;
They are happy now, and we
Soon their happiness shall see.

Lift your eyes, ye Sons of light, Zion’s city is in sight;
There our endless home shall be,
There our LORD we soon shall see.

Fear not, brethren, joyful stand
On the borders of your land;
JESUS CHRIST, your Father’s SON,
Bids you undismayed go on.

LORD, obedient we would go,
Gladly leaving all below;
Only Thou our Leader be,
And we will follow Thee.
