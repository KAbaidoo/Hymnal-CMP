HYMN 549

O for a heart to praise my GOD,
A heart from sin set free;
A heart that’s sprinkled with the
So freely shed for me: Blood
A heart resign’d, submissive, meek, My great redeemer’s Throne;
Where only CHRIST is heard to
speak,
Where JESUS reigns alone:

A humble, lowly, contrite heart,
Believing, true, and clean, part Which neither life nor death can
From Him that dwells within;

A heart in every Thought renew’d
And full of love Divine;
Perfect, and right, and pure, and
A copy, LORD, of thine, good,
Thy nature, gracious LORD, impart, Come quickly from above; heart, Write Thy new
Name upon my
Thy new best Name of Love.
