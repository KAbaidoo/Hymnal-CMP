HYMN 338

Heavenly FATHER, send Thy bless—
ing
On Thy children gathered here,
May they all, Thy Name confessing, Be to Thee forever dear:
May they be, like Joseph: loving, Dutiful, and chaste, and pure;
And their faith, like David, proving, Steadfast unto death endure.

Holy SAVIOUR, who in meekness
Didst vouchsafe a child to be,
Guide their steps, and help their weakness,
Bless and make them like to Thee; Bear Thy lambs, when they are
weary,
In Thine Arms and at Thy Breast
Through life’s desert, dry and dreary, Bring them to Thy heavenly rest.

Spread Thy golden pinions o’er
Holy SPIRIT, from above, [them, Guide them, lead them, go before them,
Give them peace, and joy, and love: Thy true temples, Holy SPIRIT,
May they with Thy glory shine,
And immortal bliss inherit,
And forevermore be Thine.
