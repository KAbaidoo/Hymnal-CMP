HYMN 394

O LORD of hosts, whose glory fills
The bounds of the eternal hills,
And yet vouchsafes, in Christian
Lands,
To dwell in temples made with hands;
Grant that all we, who here to-day
Rejoicing this foundation lay,
May be in very deed thine own,
Built on the precious Corner-stone.

Endue the creatures with Thy grace,
That shall adorn Thy dwelling-place;
The beauty of the oak and pine,
The gold and silver, make them thine.

To Thee they all belong, to Thee
The treasurers of the earth and sea;
And when we bring them to Thy
Throne,
We but present Thee with thine own.

The heads that guide endue with
skill,
The hands that work preserve from ill,
That we, who these foundations lay,
May raise the top stone in its day.

Both now and ever, LORD, protect
The temple of Thine own elect;
Be Thou in them, and they in Thee,
O Ever-blessed Trinity!
