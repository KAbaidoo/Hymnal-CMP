HYMN 94

LORD, in this Thy mercy’s day,
Ere it pass for aye away,
On our knees we fall and pray.

Holy JESUS, grant us tears.
Fill us with heart-searching fears,
Ere that awful doom appears.

LORD, on us Thy SPIRIT pour
Kneeling lowly at the door,
Ere it closes forevermore.

By Thy night of agony,
By Thy supplicating cry,
By Thy willingness to die;

By Thy tears of bitter woe
For Jerusalem below,
Let us not Thy love forego.

Grant us ‘neath Thy wings a place,
Lest we lose this day of grace
Ere we shall behold Thy Face.
