HYMN 345

Lo! round the Throne, a glorious
band,
The Saints in countless myriads stand, Of every tongue redeemed to GOD,
Arrayed in garments washed in Blood.

Through tribulation great they came; They bore the cross, despised the
shame;
From all their labors now they rest, In GOD’s eternal glory blest.

They see their SAVIOR face to face, And sing the triumphs of His grace; Him day and
night they ceaseless
praise,
To Him the loud thanksgiving raise:
“Worthy the Lamb, for sinners slain, Through endless years to live and
reign;
Thou hast redeemed us by Thy blood, And made us kings and priests to
GOD.”

O may we tread the sacred road
That Saints and holy Martyrs trod;
Wage to the end the glorious strife, And win, like them, a crown of life.
