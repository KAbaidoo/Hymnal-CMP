“Midst the doctors sitting round, Marveling at Thy words profound, Hear us, Holy JESU.

From all pride and vain conceit, From all spite and angry heat,
From all lying and deceit,

From all sloth and idleness,
From not caring for distress,
From all lust and greediness,

From refusing to obey,
From the love of our own way,
From forgetfulness to pray,
Save us, Holy JESU.

By Thy Birth and early years,
By thine infant wants and fears, By Thy sorrows and Thy tears,
Save us, Holy JESU.

By Thy Pattern bright and pure, By the pains Thou didst endure
Our salvation to procure,

By Thy Wounds and thorn-crown’d Head,
By Thy blood for sinners shed,
By Thy Rising from the dead Save us, Holy JESU.
