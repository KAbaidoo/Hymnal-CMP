HYMN 644 Lent

The abyss of many a former sin
Encloses me and bars me in:
Like billow my transgressions roll:
Be Thou the Pilot of my soul,
And to salvation’s harbor bring,
Thou SAVIOR and Thou glorious
King!

My FATHER’s heritage abused,
Wasted by lust, by sin misused;
To shame and want and misery
brought, [Though The slave to many a fruitless
I cry to Thee, who lovest men,
O pity and receive again!

In hunger now, no more possessed
Of that my portion bright and blest, The exile and the alien see,
Who yet would fain return to thee,
And save me, LORD, who seek to
raise
To Thy dear love the hymn of praise!

With that blest thief my prayer I
make,
“Remember” for Thy mercy’s sake!
With that poor publican I cry,
“Be merciful,” O GOD most high!
With that lost prodigal I fain
Back to my home would turn again!

Mourn, mourn, my soul, with earnest
care, [prayer; And raise to CHRIST the contrite
“O Thou, who freely wast made
poor,
My sorrows and my sins to cure,
Me, poor of all good works, embrace,
Enriching with Thy boundless
grace!
