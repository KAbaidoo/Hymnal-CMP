HYMN 487

The SON of Man from Jordan rose, And prayed to GOD above;
When lo, the opening Heavens dis-A swift-descending dove.
The SPIRIT, Lighting on His Brow, Anoints the Holy One;-
The FATHER’s voice declaring
"Thou art my beloved SON.”

So when, through His Baptizing blessed
The Font new birth conveys,
Man kneels a SON of GOD confessed, Heaven opens as he prays.

Fair innocence, like the dove’s, Invests him, purged from sin;
For GOD the brooding SPIRIT moves, Directs and rules within.

O CHRIST, whose mercy cleanses our stain
With streams of grace Divine;
Let us not soil the robes again Made white in Blood of thine.

Redeemer of a world undone,
We praise Thee and adore;-
JESU, with GOD the FATHER One,
And SPIRIT evermore.
