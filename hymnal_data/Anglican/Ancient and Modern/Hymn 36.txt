HYMN 36

O day of rest and gladness,
O day of joy and light,
O balm of care and sadness,
Most beautiful, most bright;

On Thee the high and lowly,
Before the eternal Throne,
Sing Holy, Holy, Holy
To the great THREE in ONE.

On Thee, at the creation,
The light first had its birth;
On Thee for our salvation
CHRIST rose from depths of earth;

On Thee our LORD victorious
The SPIRIT sent from heaven;
And thus on Thee most glorious
A triple light was given.

Thou art a cooling fountain
In life’s dry dreary sand;
From Thee, like Pisgah’s mountain,
We view our promised land;

A day of sweet reflection,
A day of holy love,
A day of resurrection
From earth to things above.

Today on weary nations
The heavenly manna falls,
The holy convocations
The silver trumpet calls,

Where gospel-light is glowing
With pure and radiant beams,
And living water flowing
With soul-refreshing streams.

New graces ever gaining
From this our day of rest,
We reach the rest remaining
To SPIRITS of the blest;

To Holy Ghost be praises,
To FATHER, and to SON;
The church her voice upraises To Thee,
blest THREE in ONE.
