HYMN 529

JESUS, where’er Thy people meet, There they behold Thy mercy-seat; Where’er they 
seek Thee Thou art found, 
And every place is hallowed ground. 

For Thou, within no walls confined, Inhabitest the humble mind; Such ever bring Thee 
when they come, 
And going, take Thee to their home. 

Great Shepherd of Thy chosen few, Thy former mercies here renew; Here to our waiting 
hearts proclaim the sweetness of Thy saving Name. 

Here may we prove the power of prayer, 
To strengthen faith and sweeten care, To teach our faint desires to rise, And bring all 
heaven before our eyes. 

LORD, we are few, but Thou art near, Nor short thine arm, nor deaf thine ear; 
O rend the heavens, come quickly down, 
And make a Thousand hearts thine own.
