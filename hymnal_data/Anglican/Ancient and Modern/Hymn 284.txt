HYMN 284

Far from my heavenly home,
Far from my FATHER’s breast,
Fainting I cry, “lest SPIRIT, come, And speed me to my rest.”

My SPIRIT homeward turns,
And fain would thither flee;
My heart, O Zion, droops and yearns, When I remember Thee.

To Thee, to Thee I press,
A dark and toilsome road;
When shall I pass the wilderness, And reach the Saint’s abode?

GOD of my life, be near;
On Thee my hopes I cast
O guide me through the desert here, And bring me home at last.
