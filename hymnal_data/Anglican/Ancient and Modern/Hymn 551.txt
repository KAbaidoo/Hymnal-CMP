HYMN 551

May the grace of CHRIST our 
SAVIOUR, 
And the FATHER’s boundless love, With the Holy SPIRIT’s favor 
Rest upon us from above. 

Thus may we abide in union 
With each other and the LORD 
And possess, in sweet communion, Joys which earth cannot afford. 

O may His overshadowing 
Make now for us this bread we bring The Body of Thy SON our LORD, 
This cup His Blood for sinners poured.
