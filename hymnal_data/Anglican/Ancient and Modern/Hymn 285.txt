HYMN 285

Fierce raged the tempest o’er the deep,
Watch did thine anxious servants
But Thou wast wrapp’d in guileless sleep, Calm and still.
“Save, LORD, we perish,” was their cry,
“O save us in our agony!”
Thy word above the storm rose high,
“Peace, be still.”
The wild winds hush’d; the angry deep
Sank, like a little child, to sleep;
The sullen billows ceased to leap,
At Thy Will.
So, when our life is clouded o’er,
And storm-winds drift us from the shore,
Say, lest we sink to rise no more,
“Peace, be still.”
