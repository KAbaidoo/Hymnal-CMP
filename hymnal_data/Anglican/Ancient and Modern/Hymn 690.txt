HYMN 690

Great Shepherd of Thy people, hear, Thy presence now display;
As Thou hast given a place for prayer, So give us hearts to pray.

Within these walls let holy peace, And love, and concord dwell;
Here give the troubled conscience
The wounded SPIRIT heal.

May we in faith receive Thy word,
In faith present our prayers,
And in the presence of our LORD
Unbosom all our cares.

The hearing ear, the seeing eyes,
The contrite heart bestow;
And shine upon us from on high,
That we in grace may grow.
