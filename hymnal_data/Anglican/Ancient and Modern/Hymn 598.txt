HYMN 598 Service

Here, LORD, we offer Thee all that
is fairest,
Flowers in their freshness from
garden and field; Gifts for the stricken ones – knowing Thou carest More for the love
than the wealth
that we yield.

Speak, LORD, by these to the sick
and the dying,
Speak to their hearts with a message—
of peace, lying, Comfort the sad who in weakness are
Grant the departing a gentle release.

Raise, LORD, to health again those
who have sickened, bloom; Fair be their lives as the roses in
Give of Thy grace to the souls Thou
hast quickened,
Gladness for sorrow, and brightness
for gloom.

We, LORD, like flowers in our
Autumn must wither; We, like these blossoms, must fade
and must die; Gather us, LORD, to Thy bosom for
Grant us a place in Thy home in the
sky.
