HYMN 381 Harvest

Praise, O praise our GOD and King; Hymns of adoration sing;
For His mercies still endure
Ever faithful, ever sure.

Praise Him that He made the sun
Day by day his course to run;
For His mercies still endure
Ever faithful, ever sure;

And the silver moon by night,
Shining with her gentle light;
For His mercies still endure
Ever faithful, ever sure.

Praise Him that He gave the rain
To mature the swelling grain;
For His mercies still endure
Ever faithful, ever sure;

And hath bid the fruitful field
Crops of precious increase yield;
For His mercies still endure
Ever faithful, ever sure;

Praise Him for our harvest-store,
He hath filled the garner-floor;
For His mercies still endure
Ever faithful, ever sure;

And for richer Food than this,
Pledge of everlasting bliss;
For His mercies still endure
Ever faithful, ever sure.

Glory to our Bounteous King;
Glory let creation sing;
Glory to the FATHER, SON, And Blest SPIRIT, THREE in ONE.
