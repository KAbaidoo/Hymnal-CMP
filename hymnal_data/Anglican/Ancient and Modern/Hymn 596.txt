HYMN 596

O SAVIOUR! when Thy loving Hand
Has brought us o’er the sea,
Through perils many, safe to land-The land we long’d to see;
Oh, help us, for Thy help we need Each moment more and more,
In perils that we scarcely heed,
More deadly, on the shore.

LORD, save us! and the Christian
Oh, help us pure to keep, [name
On sea or land, alike the same,
Til we in death shall sleep.

Then through Thy merits, watch’d
and clean From sin’s polluting stain,
In raiment white may we be seen
With all Thy Saints to reign.
