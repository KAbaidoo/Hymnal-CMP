HYMN 157

Come, HOLY GHOST, our souls inspire, And lighten with celestial fire;
Thou the anointing SPIRIT art,
Who dost Thy sevenfold gifts impart;
Thy blessed unction from above
Is comfort, life, and fire of love;
Enable with perpetual light
The dullness of our blinded sight:

Anoint and cheer our soiled face
With the abundance of Thy grace;
Keep far our foes, give peace at home; Where Thou art guide no ill can come.

Teach us to know the FATHER, SON,
And Thee, of both, to be but One;
That through the ages all along
this may be our endless Song,

Praise to Thy eternal merit,
FATHER, SON, and Holy SPIRIT.
This Hymn may also be sung at other
seasons.
