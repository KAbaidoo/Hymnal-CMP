HYMN 136

CHRIST the Lord is risen again;
CHRIST hath broken every chain;
Hark! Angelic voices cry,
Singing evermore on high,
Alleluia!

He, who gave for us His life,
Who for us endured the strife
Is our Paschal Lamb today;
We too sing for joy, and say
Alleluia!

He, who bore all pain and loss
Comfortless upon the Cross,
Lives in glory now on high,
Pleads for us, and hears our cry; Alleluia!

He, who slumbered in the grave,
Is exalted now to save;
Now through Christendom it rings That the LAMB is King of kings.
Alleluia!

Now He bids us tell abroad
How the lost may be restored,
How the penitent forgiven,
How we too may enter Heav’n.
Alleluia!

Thou, our Paschal LAMB indeed,
CHRIST, Thy ransomed people feed; Take our sins and guilt away,
Let us sing by night and day
Alleluia!
