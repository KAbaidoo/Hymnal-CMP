HYMN 70 Circumcision

The ancient law departs,
And all its terrors cease;
For JESUS makes with faithful hearts
A covenant of peace.

The Light of Light Divine,
True Brightness undefiled,
He bears for us the shame of sin,
A Holy Spotless Child.

His infant body now
Begins our pain to feel:
Those precious drops of Blood
that For death the victim seal.

Today the Name is thine
At which we bend the knee;
They call Thee JESUS deign to be.

All praise, Eternal SON,
For Thy redeeming love,
With FATHER, SPIRIT, ever One,
In glorious might above.
