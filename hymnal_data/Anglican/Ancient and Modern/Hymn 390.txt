HYMN 390 Processional

Brightly gleams our banner Pointing to the sky,
Waving wanderers onward
To their home on high,
Journeying o’er the desert, Gladly thus we pray,
And with hearts united
Take our heavenward way,
Brightly gleams our banner Pointing to the sky,
Waving wanderers onward
To their home on high.

JESUS, LORD and Master,
At Thy sacred Feet,
Here with hearts rejoicing See Thy children meet;
Often have we left Thee,
Often gone astray;
Keep us, mighty SAVIOUR,
In the narrow way.
Brightly gleams, etc.
All our days direct us
In the way we go,
Lead us on victorious
Over every foe;
Bid thine Angels shield us When the storm-clouds lower,
Pardon, LORD, and save us
In the last dread hour,
Brightly gleams, etc.
Then with saints and Angels May we join above,
Offering prayer and praises At Thy Throne of love;
When the toil is over,
Then comes rest and peace, JESUS in His beauty,
songs that never cease.
Brightly gleams, etc.
