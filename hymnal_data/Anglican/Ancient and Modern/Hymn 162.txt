HYMN 162

Have mercy on us, GOD most High, Who lift our hearts to Thee;
Have mercy on us worms of earth, Most Holy Trinity.

Most ancient of all mysteries!
Before Thy Throne we lie;
Have mercy now, most Merciful,
Most Holy Trinity.

When heaven and earth were yet
unmade,
When time was yet unknown
Thou, in Thy bliss and majesty, Didst live and love alone.

How wonderful creation is,
The work that Thou didst bless
And oh, what then must Thou be like, Eternal Loveliness!

Most ancient of all mysteries!
Low at Thy Throne we lie;

Have mercy now, most Merciful
Most Holy Trinity.
