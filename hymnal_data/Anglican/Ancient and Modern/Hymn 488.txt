HYMN 488

Within the FATHER’s house
The SON hath found His home;
And to His temple suddenly
The LORD of life hath come.

The doctors of the law
Gaze on the wondrous Child,
And marvel at His gracious words Of wisdom undefiled.

Yet not to them is given
The mighty truth to know,
To lift the fleshly veil which hides Incarnate GOD below.

The secret of the LORD
Escapes each human eye,
And faithful pondering hearts await The full Epiphany.

LORD, visit Thou our souls,
And teach us by Thy grace
Each dim revealing of Thyself
With loving awe to trace;

Till from our darkened sight
The cloud shall pass away,
And on the cleansed soul shall burst The everlasting day;

Till we behold Thy Face,
And know, as we are known,
Thee, FATHER, SON, and Holy
Co-equal THREE in ONE, Ghost.
