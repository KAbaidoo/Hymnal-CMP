HYMN 431

Disposer Supreme,
And Judge of the earth,
Who choosest for thine
The weak and the poor
To frail earthen vessels
And things of no worth
Entrusting Thy riches
Which aye shall endure;

Those vessels soon fail,
Though full of Thy light,
And at Thy decree
Are broken and gone;
Thence brightly appeareth
Thy truth in its might,
As through the clouds riven The lightnings have shone.

Like clouds are they borne To do Thy great will;
And swift as the winds
About the world go;
The Word with His wisdom
Their spirits doth fill,
They thunder, they lighten, The waters o’erflow.

Their sound goeth forth,
“CHRIST JESUS the LORD”.
Then Satan doth fear,
His citadels fall:
As when the dread trumpets Went forth at Thy Word,
And one long blast shattered The Canaanite’s wall.

O loud be their trump,
And stirring their sound,
To rouse us, O LORD,
From slumber of sin:
The lights Thou hast kindled In darkness around,
O may they illuminate
Our spirits within.

All honour and praise,
Dominion and might,
To GOD, THREE in ONE,
Eternally be,
Who round us hath shed
His own marvelous light,
And called us from darkness His glory to see.
