HYMN 768

JESUS! speak to me in love,
Restless, storm-tossed in my sin:
With Thy mighty voice, O LORD,
Thy great calm create within;
Bid the stormy winds to cease.
Bid, O bid me go in peace.

To Thee, JESUS, do I fly,
Wakened from my soul's dread sleep;
None but Thou can save me, LORD,
In this hour of anguish deep;
Thou alone canst give release
Bid, O bid me go in peace.

Weeping at Thy feet I fall,
Wearied, burdened, lonely, sad;
Thou dost bid me come, my LORD,
Thou alone canst make me glad;
JESUS, grant my soul release
Bid, O bid me go in peace.

Boldly, Thy Throne of grace,
LORD, I now forgiveness seek;
In Thy tender, pitying love
To my soul Thy pardon speak
JESUS! make my anguish cease
Bid, O bid me go in peace.

Prince of Peace, who in Thy death
Didst for me the ransom pay,
Cleanse me in Thy peace today
Now, LORD, grant my soul release
Now LORD bid me go in peace.
