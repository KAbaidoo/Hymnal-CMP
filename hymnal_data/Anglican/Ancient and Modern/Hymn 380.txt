HYMN 380 Friendly Societies

O Praise our GOD today,
His constant mercy bless,
Whose love hath helped us on our way,
And granted us success.

His arm the strength imparts
Our daily toil to bear;
His grace alone inspires our hearts
Each other’s load to share.

O happiest work below,
Earnest of joy above,
To sweeten many a cup of woe
By deeds of holy love!

LORD, may it be our choice
This blessed rule to keep,
“Rejoice with them that do rejoice,
And weep with them that weep,”

O praise our GOD today,
His constant mercy bless,
Whose love hath helped us on our way,
And granted us success.
