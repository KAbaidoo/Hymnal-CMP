HYMN 74

FATHER, let me dedicate
All this year to Thee,
In whatever worldly state
Thou wilt have me be:

Not from sorrow, pain, or care Freedom dare I claim;
This alone shall be my prayer, Glorify Thy name.
Can a child presume to choose where or how to live?
Can a FATHER’s love refuse
All the best to give?

More Thou givest every day
Than the best can claim,
Nor withholdest aught that may
Glorify Thy name.
If in mercy Thou wilt spare

Joys that yet are mine;
If on life, serene and fair,
Brighter rays may shine;
Let my glad heart, while it sings,
Thee in all proclaim,

And, whate’er the future brings,
Glorify Thy name.
If Thou callest to the cross,
And its shadow come,
Turning all my gain to loss,

Shrouding heart and home;
Let me think how Thy dear SON
To His glory came,
And in deepest woe pray on,
“Glorify Thy Name.”
