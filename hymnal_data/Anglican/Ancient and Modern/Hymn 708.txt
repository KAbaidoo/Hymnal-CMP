HYMN 708 National

GOD of our FATHERS, unto Thee
Our FATHERS cried in danger’s hour,
And then Thou gavest them to see
The acts of thine almighty power.
They cried to Thee, and Thou didst hear;
They called on Thee, and Thou didst save;
And we their Sons to-day draw near
Thy Name to praise, Thy help to crave.
LORD GOD of Hosts, uplift thine hand, Protect and bless our FATHERland.

Thine is the majesty, O LORD,
And thine dominion over all;
When Thou commandest, at Thy will
Great kings and nations rise or fall, For eastern realms, for western coasts,
For islands washed by every sea.
The praise be given, O GOD of Hosts, Not unto us but unto Thee.
LORD GOD of Hosts, uplift thine hand, Protect and bless our FATHERland.

If in Thy grace Thou shouldst allow Our fame to wax through coming days,
Still grant us humbly, then as now,
Thy help to crave, Thy Name to praise.
Not all alike in speech and birth,
Alike we bow before Thy Throne;
One FATHERland throughout the earth
Our FATHER’s noble acts we own.
LORD GOD of Hosts, uplift thine hand, Protect and bless our FATHERland.
