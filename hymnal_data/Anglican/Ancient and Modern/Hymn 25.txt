HYMN 25

Through the day Thy love has
Spared us;
Now we lay us down to rest;
Through the silent watches guard us,
Let no foe our peace molest;
JESUS, Thou our guardian be;
Sweet it is to trust in Thee,

Pilgrims here on earth, and strangers,
Dwelling in the midst of foes;
Us and ours preserve from dangers;
In thine arms may we repose,
And, when life’s sad day is past,
Rest with Thee in Heav’n at last.
