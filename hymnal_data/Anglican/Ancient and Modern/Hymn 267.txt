HYMN 267

LORD, as to Thy dear cross we flee, And plead to be forgiven.
So let Thy life our pattern be,
And form our souls for heav’n.

Help us, through good report and ill, Our daily cross to bear;
Like Thee, to do our FATHER’s will, Our brethren’s griefs to share.

Let grace our selfishness expel,
Our earthliness refine;
And kindness in our bosoms dwell, As free and true as thine.

If joy shall at Thy bidding fly, And grief’s dark day come on,
We in our turn would meekly cry, “FATHER, Thy will be done.”

Kept peaceful in the midst of strife, Forgiving and forgiven,
O may we lead the pilgrim’s life, And follow Thee to heav’n.
