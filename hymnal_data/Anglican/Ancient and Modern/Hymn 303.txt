HYMN 303

When morning gilds the skies, My heart awaking cries,
May JESUS CHRIST be praised:
Alike at work and prayer
To JESUS I repair;
May JESUS CHRIST be praised:
Oh ark to what it sings
As joyously it rings,
May JESUS CHRIST be praised:

My tongue shall never tire
Of chanting with the choir
May JESUS CHRIST be praised:
This Song of sacred joy,
It never seems to cloy,
May JESUS CHRIST be praised.

When sleep her balm denies,
My silent SPIRIT sighs,
May JESUS CHRIST be praised.
When evil Thought molest,
With this I shield my breast, May JESUS CHRIST be praised

Does sadness fill my mind?
A solace here I find,
May JESUS CHRIST be praised:
Or fades my earthly bliss?
My comfort still is this,
May JESUS CHRIST be praised.

The night becomes as day,
When from the heart we say,
May JESUS CHRIST be praised:
The powers of darkness fear,
When this sweet chant they hear, May JESUS CHRIST be praised.

In Heav’n eternal bliss
The loveliest strain is this, May JESUS CHRIST be praised;
Let earth, and sea, and sky
From depth to height reply,
May JESUS CHRIST be praised.

Be this, while life is mine,
My canticle divine,
May JESUS CHRIST be praised:
Through ages all along,
May JESUS CHRIST be praised.
