HYMN 29

O FATHER, who didst all things make
Thy will, that heaven and earth might do
bless us this night for JESU’s sake,
and for Thy work preserve us still.

O SON, who didst redeem mankind,
And set the captive sinner free,
Keep us this night with peaceful mind,
That we may safe abide in Thee.

O HOLY GHOST, who by the power
The church elect dost sanctify,
Seal us this night, and hour by hour
Our hearts and members purify.

To FATHER, SON, and HOLY GHOST,
The GOD whom Heaven and earth adore.
From men and from the Angel-host
Be praise and glory evermore.
