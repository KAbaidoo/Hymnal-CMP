HYMN 772

I need Thee, precious JESUS,
For I am full of sin;
My soul is dark and guilty,
My heart is dead within,
I need the cleansing Fountain Where I can always flee
The blood of CHRIST most precious, The sinner’s perfect plea.

I need Thee, precious JESUS
For I am very poor;
A stranger and a pilgrim
I have no earthly store
I need the love of JESUS
To cheer me on my way
To guide my doubting footsteps To be my strength and stay.

I need Thee, precious JESUS;
I need a friend like Thee,
A friend to soothe and pity
A friend to care for me
I need the Heart of JESUS
To feel each anxious care,
To tell my every trouble,
And all my sorrow share.

I need Thee, precious JESUS;
I need Thee day by day,
To fill me with Thy fullness
To lead me on my way
I need Thy Holy SPIRIT
To teach me what I am
To show me more of JESUS
To point me to the Lamb

I need Thee, precious JESUS,
And hope to see Thee soon
Encircled by the rainbow
And seated on Thy Throne;
There, with Thy blood-bought children My joy shall ever be,
To sing Thy praises, JESUS,
To gaze, my LORD, on Thee.
