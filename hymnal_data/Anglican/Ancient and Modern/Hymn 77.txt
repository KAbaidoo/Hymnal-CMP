HYMN 77

WHAT star is this, with beams so bright,
More beauteous than the noonday light?
It shines to herald forth the King,
And Gentiles to His cradle bring.

See now fulfilled what GOD decreed,
“From Jacob shall a star proceed;
And Eastern sages with amaze
Upon the wondrous vision gaze.

The guiding star above is bright
Within them shines a clearer light
Which leads them on with power benign
To seek the Giver of the sign.

True love can brook no dull delay,
Nor toil nor dangers stop their way
Home, kindred, father-land, and all
They leave at their Creator’s call.

O JESU, while the star of grace
Allures us now to seek Thy Face,
Let not our slothful hearts refuse
The guidance of that light to use.

All glory, JESU, be to Thee
For this Thy glad Epiphany,
Whom with the FATHER we adore
And HOLY GHOST for evermore.
