HYMN 613 Apostle

Praise to the Heavenly Wisdom
Who knows the hearts of all—
The saintly life’s beginnings,
The traitor’s secret fall;
Our own ascended Master,
Who heard His Church’s cry,
Made known His guiding presence, And ruled her from on high.

Elect in His foreknowledge,
To fill the lost one’s place;
He formed His chosen vessel
By hidden gifts of grace,
Then, by the lot’s disposing,
He lifted up the poor,
And set him with the Princes
On high for evermore.

For on the golden breastplate
Of our great Priest above,
Twelve are the stones that glisten As throbs that Heart of Love;
And twelve the fair foundations
Of Salem’s jasper all;
And twelve the Thrones predestined Within her judgment-hall.

No mystic gem is lacking
In that Divine array;
No empty Throne shall darken
The glory of that day;
For lo! on Twelve the SPIRIT,
The FATHER’s Promise, came;
And Twelve went forth together
To preach the saving Name

Still guide Thy Church, Chief Shep-Her losses still renew; [herd, Be Thy dread keys
entrusted
To faithful hands and true;
Apostles of Thy choosing
May all her rulers be,
That each with joy may render
His last account to Thee!
