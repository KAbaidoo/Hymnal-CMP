HYMN 748 Burial of the Dead

O LORD, to Whom the SPIRITS live
Of all the faithful passed away,
Unto their path that brightness give Which shineth to the perfect day.
O Lamb of GOD, Redeemer blest,
Grant them eternal light and rest.

Bless Thou the dead which die in
Thee;
As Thou hast given them release,
So quicken them Thy face to see,
And give them everlasting peace.
O Lamb of GOD, etc.

In Thy green, pleasant pastures feed The sheep which Thou hast summoned hence;
And by the still, cool waters lead
Thy flock in loving providence.
O Lamb of GOD, etc.

How long, O Holy LORD, how long
Must we and they expectant wait
to hear the gladsome bridal Song,
To see Thee in Thy royal state?
O Lamb of GOD, etc.

Hearken, SAVIOUR, to their cry,
O rend the heavens and come down
Make up Thy jewels speedily,
And set them in Thy golden crown.
O Lamb of GOD, etc.

Direct us with thine arm of might
And bring us, perfected with them
To dwell within Thy city bright,
The heavenly Jerusalem.
O Lamb of GOD, etc.
