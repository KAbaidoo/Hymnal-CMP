HYMN 44
Saturday

Six days of labor now are past;
Thou restest, Holy GOD;
And of Thy finish’d work hast said
That all is very good.

Yet while the seventh day is bless’d,
Hallowed for rest Divine,
Behold, a new creation needs
That mighty power of thine.

Ten Thousand voices praise
Thy name In earth and sea and sky;
One sinner by his sin has marred
The blissful harmony.

O LORD, create man’s heart anew,
The heart and voice agree;
O for the prayers that plead
a right With Thy dread Majesty.

All praise to GOD, the THREE in ONE,
Who high in glory reigns;
Who by His word hath all things made,
And by His word sustains.
