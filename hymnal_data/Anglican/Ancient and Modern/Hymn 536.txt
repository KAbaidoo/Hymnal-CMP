HYMN 536

There is a land of pure delight, Where Saints immortal reign:
Infinite day excludes the night, And pleasures banish pain.

There everlasting spring abides, And never-withering flowers;
Death, like a narrow sea, divides That heavenly sand from ours.

Sweet fields beyond the swelling Stand dressed in living green;
So to the Jews old Canaan stood, While Jordan rolled between.

But timorous mortals start and
To cross the narrow sea,
And linger shivering on the brink, And fear to launch away,

Oh, could we make our doubts re—
move,
Those gloomy doubts that rise,
And see the Canaan that we love
With unbeclouded eyes:

Could we but climb where Moses
And view the landscape o’er;
Not Jordan’s stream, nor death’s cold flood,
Should fright us from the shore.
