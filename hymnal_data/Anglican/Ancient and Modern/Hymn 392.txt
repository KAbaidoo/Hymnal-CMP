HYMN 392

Forward! be our watchword,
Steps and voices joined;
Seek the things before us,
Not a look behind;
Burns the fiery pillar
At our army’s head;
Who shall dream of shrinking, By our Captain led?
Forward through the desert,
Through the toil and fight;
Jordan flows before us,
Sin beams with light.

Forward, when in childhood
Buds the infant mind;
All through youth and manhood, Not a Thought behind;
Speed through realms of nature, Climb the steps of grace;
Faint not, till in glory
Gleams our FATHER’s face.
Forward, all the lifetime,
Climb from height to height; Till the head be hoary,
Till the eve be light.

Forward, flock of JESUS,
Salt of all the earth,
Till each yearning purpose
Spring to glorious birth;
Sick, they ask for healing,
Blind, they grope for day;
Pour upon the nations
Wisdom’s loving ray,
Forward, out of error,
Leave behind the night;
Forward through the darkness, Forward into light.

Glories upon glories
Hath our GOD prepared,
By the souls that love Him
One day to be shared;
Eye hath not beheld them.
