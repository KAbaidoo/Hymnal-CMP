HYMN 496

O Scorned and outcast LORD,
beneath
Thy ………… meekly bending,
Thou, our true Isaac, to Thy death Art wearily ascending.

And soon, with nail-pierced feet and Hands
Upon the cross they raise Thee; The Cross, which there uplifted stands,
To all earth displays Thee.

Oh! wondrous love of GOD on high, The sinful thus to cherish!
He gave His guiltless SON to die, Lest guilty man should perish.

Our sin’s pollution to remove
His blood was freely given;
So mighty was the SAVIOUR’s love, So just the wrath of Heaven.

Yes! ‘tis the cross that breaks the rod
And chain of condemnation,
And makes a league ‘twixt man and GOD
For our entire salvation.

O praise the FATHER, praise the SON, The Lamb for sinners given,
And HOLY GHOST, through whom
Our hearts are raised to heaven.
