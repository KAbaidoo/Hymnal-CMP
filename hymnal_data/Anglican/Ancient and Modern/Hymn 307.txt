HYMN 307

O SAVIOR, precious SAVIOR,
Whom yet unseen we love,
O Name of might and favor,
All other names above!
We worship Thee, we bless Thee, To Thee alone we sing;
We praise Thee, and confess Thee Our holy LORD and king

O bringer of salvation,
Who wondrously hast wrought,
Thyself the revelation
Of love beyond our thought;
We worship Thee, we bless Thee, To Thee alone we sing;
We praise Thee, and confess Thee Our gracious LORD and king

In Thee all fullness dwelleth, All grace and power divine;
The glory that excelleth,
O SON of GOD, is thine;
We worship Thee, we bless Thee, Our glorious LORD and King.

O grant the consummation
Of this our Song above
In endless adoration,
And everlasting love;

Then shall we praise and bless Thee Where perfect praises ring,
And evermore confess Thee
Our SAVIOR and our King.
