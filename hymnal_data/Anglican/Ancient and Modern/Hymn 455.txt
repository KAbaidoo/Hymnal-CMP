HYMN 455 FOR A VIRGIN

JESU, the Virgins’ Crown, do Thou
Accept us as in prayer we bow
Born of that Virgin whom alone
The Mother and the Maid we own,

Amongst the lilies Thou dost feed,
And thither choirs of Virgins lead;
Adorning all Thy chosen brides
With glorious gifts Thy love provides.

And whither, LORD, Thy footsteps
wend,
The Virgins still with praise attend; For Thee they pour their sweetest
Song,
And after Thee rejoicing throng.

O gracious LORD, we Thee implore
Thy grace on every sense to pour;
From all pollution keep us free,
And make us pure in heart for Thee.

All praise to GOD the FATHER be,
All praise, Eternal SON, to Thee,
Whom with the SPIRIT We adore
For ever and for evermore.
