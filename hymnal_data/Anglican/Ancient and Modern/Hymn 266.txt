HYMN 266

Lead, kindly light, amid the encircling gloom, Lead Thou me on. The night is dark, and I am far from home Lead Thou me on. Keep Thou my feet: I do not ask to see The distant scene; one step enough for me.

I was not ever thus, nor prayed that Thou Shouldst lead me on; I loved to choose and see my path; but now Lead Thou me on. I loved the garish day, and, spite of fears, Pride ruled my will: remember not past years.

So long Thy power hath blest me. sure it still will lead me on, [rent , til O’er moor and fen, o’er crag and tor— The night is gone; And with the morn those Angel faces smile, Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile.
