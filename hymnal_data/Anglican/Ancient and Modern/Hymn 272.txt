HYMN 272

O SAVIOUR, may we never rest
Til Thou art form’d within,
Til Thou has calm’d our troubled breast,
And crush’d the power of sin.

O may we gaze upon Thy Cross,
Until the wondrous sight
Makes earthly treasures seem but dross,
And earthly sorrow light:

Until, released from carnal ties,
Our SPIRIT upward springs,
And see true peace above the skies,
True joy in heavenly things.

There as we gaze, may we become
United, LORD, to Thee,
And, in a fairer, happier home,
Thy perfect beauty see.
