HYMN 687

Still Throned in heaven, to men in
unbelief
CHRIST spreads His hands all day:
They scan His claims, give judgment
cold and brief.
And fearless turn away.

Once more, O peerless mystery of
Thy sweet appeal renew; [grace!
Light up dark minds; win souls to
thine embrace; High forts of doubt subdue.

Speak, till the Sons of peace, with
hearts unseared, Led by that voice of thine,
Find Him each day more glorious,
more endeared, CHRIST human, CHRIST divine.
