HYMN 495

Weep not for Him who onward
His Cross to Calvary bears; He does not ask man’s pitying tears, Who wills for man to die.

The awful sorrow of His face,
The bowing of His Frame,
Come not from torture or disgrace; He fears not cross or shame.

There is a deeper pang of grief, An agony unknown,
In which His Love finds no relief; He bears it all alone.

He thinks of all for whom His Life Of lowliness and pain,
And weariness and care and strife, Will be alas! in vain.

He sees the souls for whom He dies Yet clinging to their sin,
And heirs of mansions in the skies Who will not enter in.

Ah! this, my SAVIOUR, was the
shame
That bowed Thy Head so low!
These were the wounds that racked Thy frame,
And made Thy tears to flow.

Oh! may I in Thy sorrow share,
And mourn that sins of mine
Should ever wound with grief or care That loving heart of thine.
