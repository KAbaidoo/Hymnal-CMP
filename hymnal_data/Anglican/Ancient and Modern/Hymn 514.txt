HYMN 514

FATHER of all, to Thee
With loving hearts we pray,
Through Him, in mercy given, The life, the Truth, the Way; From heaven Thy Throne, in mercy shed
Thy blessings on each bended head.

FATHER of all, to Thee
Our contrite hearts we raise, Unstrung by sin and pain,
Long voiceless in Thy praise; Breathe Thou the silent chords along, Until they tremble
into Song.

FATHER of all, to Thee
We breathe unuttered fears,
Deep-hidden in our souls,
That have no voice but tears, Deep-hidden in our souls,
That have no voice but tears; Take Thou our hands, and through the wild
Lead gently on each trustful child.

FATHER of all, may we
In praise our tongues employ, When gladness fills the soul With deep and hallowed joy;
In storm and calm give us to see The path of peace which leads to Thee.
