HYMN 490 Lent
Sweet SAVIOR! in Thy pitying grace
Thy sweetness to our souls impart;
Thou only Lover of our race
Give healing to the wounded heart;
Oh! hear Thy contrite servants' cry, And save us,
JESUS! lest we die

Long-suffering JESUS! hear our prayer 
Who weep before Thee in our shame; We have no 
hope but Thee; O spare, LORD, 
spare us from the undying flame; 
Oh! hear Thy contrite servants’ cry, 
And save us, JESUS! lest we die

All we have broken Thy command; 
LORD, help us for Thy mercies' sake;
Deliver us from Satan’s hand,
And safely to Thy Kingdom take;
Oh! hear Thy contrite servants' cry, 
And save us, JESUS! lest we die

We flee for refuge to Thy love, 
Salvation of the helpless soul;
Pour down Thy radiance from above,
And make these sin-worn SPIRITS whole;
Good LORD, in mercy hear our cry,
And save us, JESUS! lest we die.
