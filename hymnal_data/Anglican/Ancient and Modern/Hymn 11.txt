HYMN 11
The Ninth Hour

O GOD, of all the Strength and Power,
Who dost, Thyself unmoved, each hour
Through all its changes guide the day,
From early morn to evening’s ray;

Brighten life’s eventide with light
That ne’er shall set in gloom of night,
Till we a holy death attain,
And everlasting glory gain.

Almighty FATHER, hear our cry
Through JESUS CHRIST our LORD Most High,
Who with the HOLY GHOST and Thee,
Doth live and reign eternally.
