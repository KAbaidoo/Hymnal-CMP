HYMN 302

Come, ye faithful, raise the anthem, Cleave the skies with shouts of
praise;
Sing to Him who found the ransom,
Ancient of eternal days,
GOD of GOD that Word Incarnate,
Whom the heav’n obeys.

Ere He raised the lofty mountains,
Formed the seas, or built the sky, Love eternal, free, and boundless, Moved the LORD of
Life to die,
Fore-ordained the Prince of princes For the Throne of Calvary.

There, for us and our redemption, See Him at His life-blood pour!
There He wins our full salvation, Dies that we may die no more;
Then, arising, lives forever
Reigning where He was before,

High on yon celestial mountains
Stands His gem-built Throne, all
bright,
Midst unending Alleluias
Bursting from the Sons of light;
Zion’s people tell His praises,
Victor after hard-won fight.

Bring your harps, and bring your
odours,
Sweep the string and pour the lay; Let the earth proclaim His wonders, King of that
celestial day;
He the Lamb once slain is worthy, Who was dead, and lives for aye,

Laud and honour to the FATHER,
Laud and honour to the SON,
Laud and honour to the SPIRIT,
Ever Three and ever One,
Consubstantial, Co-eternal,
While unending ages run.
