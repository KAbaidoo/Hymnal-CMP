HYMN 587 Missions

LORD of the harvest! it is right and
meet
That we should lay our first-fruits
at Thy feet
With joyful Alleluia.

Sweet is the soul’s thanksgiving
after prayer;
Sweet is the worship that with
Heav’n we share, Who sing the Alleluia!

Lowly we prayed, and Thou didst
hear on high_
Didst lift our hearts and change our
suppliant cry
To festal Alleluia.

So sing we now in tune with that
great Song,
That all the age of ages shall prolong.
The endless Alleluia.

To The, O LORD of Harvest, who
hast heard,
And to Thy white-robed reapers
given the word,
We sing our Alleluia.

O CHRIST, who in the wide world’s
ghostly sea
Hast bid the net be cast anew, to
The
We sing our Alleluia.
To The, Eternal SPIRIT, who again
Hast moved with life upon the
slumberous main, We sing our Alleluia.

Yea, West and East the companies
go forth;
“We come!” is sounding to the
South and North: To GOD sing Alleluia.

The fishermen of JESUS far away
Seek in new waters an immortal
prey:
To CHRIST sing Alleluia,
The Holy Dove is brooding o’er the
deep,
And careless hearts are waking out
of sleep;
To Him sing Alleluia.

Yea, for sweet hope new-born—
blest work begun_
Sing Alleluia to the THREE in ONE,
Adoring Alleluia.
