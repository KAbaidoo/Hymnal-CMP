HYMN 533

Oh how fair that morning broke,
When in Eden man awoke!
Beast and bird and insect bright
Revelled in the gladsome light;
GOD looked down from Heav'n above.
All was life and joy and love.

Ah! the doleful change when sin
Darkly, subtly entered in!
War and pestilence and dearth
Mar and sadden GOD's fair earth;
Human sorrow fills the air;
Death is reigning everywhere.

Yet rejoice: for GOD on high
Hath not left His world to die!
GOD's dear SON, with dying breath, Broke the power of sin and death; CHRIST the
Tempter overthrew,
CHRIST is making all things new.

Lord, in me be sin subdued
So may I with heart renewed,
Fight the fight and run the race, Work in my appointed pace,
Waiting for the glad new birth
Of Thy perfect Heav'n and earth.
