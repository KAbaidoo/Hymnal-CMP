HYMN 117

At the cross her station keeping
Stood the mournful mother weeping
Where he hung, the dying LORD
For her soul of joy bereaved,
Bow'd with anguish, deeply grieved, Felt the sharp and piercing sword,

Oh, how sad and sore distressed
Now was she, that mother blessed
Of the sole-begotten one;
Deep the woe of affliction,
When she saw the crucifixion
Of her ever-glorious SON.

Who, on CHRIST’s dear mother gaze
Pierced by anguish so amazing,
Born of woman, would not weep?
Who, on CHRIST’s dear mother think
Such a cup of sorrow drinking,
Would not share her sorrows deep?

For his people’s sins chastised
She beheld her SON despised.
Scourged and crown’d with thorns entwined
Saw him then from judgment taken
And in death by all forsaken,
Til his SPIRIT he resign’d.

JESU, may her deep devotion
Stir in me the same emotion,
Fount of love, redeemer kind,
That my heart fresh ardor gaining
And a purer love attaining,
May with Thee acceptance find.
