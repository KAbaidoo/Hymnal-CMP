HYMN 602 Church

O Jerusalem the blissful, Home of
gladness yet untold; Thou whose countless throngs
triumphal fill with joy Thy street of gold;
Graven on Thee, new and glorious,
they the King’s own Name behold!

Many are Thy Sons, O Mother, yon
august and shining band!
Gentle Peace in all Thy borders makes
the glad, O happy land!
Perfect is Thy Restoration, bright in
holiness to stand.

Here, a figure of the Heavenly,
shines our temple, worthier grown
By its richer restoration on the old
foundation-stone,
With a majesty and beauty to the
former house unknown.

LORD, we pray Thee, Master-Builder,
Great and Holy, enter in,
Fill Thy sanctuary quickly, as our
hallowing rites begin
And Thyself its consecrator rest for
evermore therein.

Make Thy servants, Though unworthy,
temples of Thy grace to be;
Let us not in flesh or SPIRIT prove
disloyal unto Thee, But in dedicated service praise Thy
Name adoringly.

Make, O Royal Priest, thine Altar
here henceforth a Throne of light,
Ever held in highest honour, and
with many a gift made bright,
Ever blessed, ever peaceful, ever
precious in Thy sight.

Yea, our hearts, for these Thou
judgest, as Thy cleansed Altars bless,
By Thy SPIRIT’s grace renew us unto
perfect holiness,
And the sevenfold gifts from Heaven
grant us ever to possess.

Now to Thee, through endless ages,
O most Holy Trinity, Highest honour, power unmeasured,
everlasting glory be;
GOD forever and forever, Three in
One and One in Three.
