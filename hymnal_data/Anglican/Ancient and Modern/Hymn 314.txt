HYMN 314

O food that weary pilgrims love,
O Bread of Angel-hosts above,
O Manna of the Saints,
The hungry soul would feed on Thee, Ne'er may the heart unsolaced be
Which for Thy sweetness faints.

O Fount of love, O cleansing tide, Which from the SAVIOUR’s pierced
And sacred Heart dost flow, Be ours to drink of Thy pure rill, Which only can our
SPIRITs fill,
And all our need bestow.

LORD JESUS, Whom, by power Divine
Now hidden ‘neath the outward sign, We worship and adore,
Grant, when the veil away is roll'd, With open face we may behold
Thyself forevermore.
