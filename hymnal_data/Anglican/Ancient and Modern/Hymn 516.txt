HYMN 516

Before Jehovah’s awful Throne,
Ye nations, bow with sacred joy; know that the LORD is GOD alone; He can create, and
He destroy.

His sovereign power, without our aid, Made us of clay, and formed us men; And when like
wandering sheep we strayed,
He brought us to His fold again.

We’ll crowd Thy gates with thankful songs; High as the heavens our voices raise; And
earth, with her ten thousand tongues,
Shall fill Thy courts with sounding praise.

Wide as the world is Thy command; Vast as eternity Thy love;
Firm as a rock Thy truth shall stand, When rolling years shall cease to move.
