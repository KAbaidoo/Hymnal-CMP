HYMN 241

Hosanna to the living LORD!
Hosanna to the Incarnate Word,
TO CHRIST, Creator, SAVIOR, King,
Let earth, let heaven Hosanna sing, Hosanna in the highest!

O SAVIOR, with protecting care
Abide in this Thy house of prayer,
Where we Thy parting promise claim, Assembled in Thy sacred Name.
Hosanna in the highest!

But, chiefest, in our cleansed breast, Eternal, bid Thy SPIRIT test;
And make our secret soul to be
A temple pure and worthy Thee.
Hosanna in the highest!

To GOD the FATHER, GOD the SON,
And GOD the SPIRIT, THREE in ONE,
Be honor, praise, and glory given By all on earth all in heaven.
Hosanna in the highest!
