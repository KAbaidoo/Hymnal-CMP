HYMN 354

The earth, O LORD, is one wide 
Of all Thy chosen seed; The crop prepared its fruit to yield; The laborers few 
indeed. 

We therefore come before Thee now With fasting, and with prayer, 
Beseeching of Thy love that Thou 
Wouldst send more laborers there, 
Not for our land alone we pray, 
Though that above the rest; 
The realms and islands far away, 
O let them all be blest. 

Endue the Bishops of Thy flock 
With wisdom and with grace, 
Against false doctrine, like a rock, To set the heart and face. 

To all Thy Priests Thy truth reveal, And make Thy judgments clear; 
And humble, and sincere: 

And give their flocks a lowly mind To hear and to obey; 
That each and all may mercy find 
At thine appearing day.
