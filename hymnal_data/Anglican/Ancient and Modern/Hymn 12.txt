HYMN 12
Evening

O Strength and Stay upholding all Creation, 
Who ever dost Thyself unmoved abide, 
Yet day by day the light in due Gradation 
From hour to hour through all its changes guide;

Grant to life’s day a calm unclouded Ending, 
An eve untouched by shadows of decay, 
The brightness of a holy death-bed Blending
With dawning glories of the eternal day,

Hear us, O FATHER, gracious and Forgiving, 
Through JESUS CHRIST Thy co-eternal Word Who, 
with the HOLY GHOST, by all Things living 
Now and to endless ages art adored.
