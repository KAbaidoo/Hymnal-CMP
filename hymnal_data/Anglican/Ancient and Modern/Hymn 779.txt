HYMN 779

There was joy in heaven,
There was joy in heaven,
When this goodly world to frame
The LORD of might and mercy came; Shouts of joy were heard on high, And the stars
sang from the sky
Glory to GOD in heaven.

There was joy in heaven,
There was joy in heaven,
When the billows heaving dark,
Sank around the stranded ark,
And the rainbow’s watery span
Spoke of mercy, hope to man,
And peace with GOD in heaven.

There was joy in heaven,
There was joy in heaven,
When of love the towers of Bethlehem, And along the echoing hail
Angels sang “On earth good will,
And glory in the heaven!”

There was joy in heaven,
There was joy in heaven,
When the soul that went astray
Turns to CHRIST, the living Way, And, by grace of heaven subdued, Breathes a prayer of
gratitude:
Oh, there is joy in heaven.
