HYMN 352 Ember Days

CHRIST is gone from us; yet ere He passed From earth, in Heaven to reign,
He formed one holy Church to last Till He should come again.

His twelve Apostles first He made His ministers of grace;
And they their hands on others laid, To fill in turn their place.

So age by age, and year by year, His grace was handed on;
And still the holy Church is here, Although her LORD is gone,

Let those find pardon, LORD, from Thee,
Whose love to her is cold:
Bring wanderers in, and let there be One Shepherd and one fold.
