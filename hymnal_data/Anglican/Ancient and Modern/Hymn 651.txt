HYMN 651

Glory to GOD! The morn appointed
breaks
And earth awakes from all the
woeful past;
For, with the morn, the LORD of life
awakes,
And sin and death into the grave are cast.

Glory to GOD! the cross, with all its
shame,
Now sheds its glory o’er a ransom’d world:
For He who bore the burden of our
blame,
With pierced hands the foe to hell hath hurl’d.

Glory to GOD! sing, ransom’d souls
again,
And let your songs our glorious
Victor laud,
Who by His might hath snapp’d the
tyrant’s chain,
And set us free to rise with Him to GOD.

Darkness and night, farewell! the
morn is here;
Welcome! the light that ushers in
the day;
Visions of joy before our sight appear,
And, like the clouds, our sorrow melt away.

Great SON of GOD, immortal, and
renown’d!
Brighter than morn the glory on Thy
brow;
Crowns must be won, and Thou art
nobly crowned,
For death is dead, and sin is vanquish’d now.
