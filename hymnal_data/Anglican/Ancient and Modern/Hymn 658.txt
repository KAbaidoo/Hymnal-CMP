HYMN 658

Thou, LORD, by strictest search hast
known
My rising up and lying down;
My secret thoughts are known to
Thee
Known long before conceived by me.

Thine eye my bed and path surveys,
My public haunts and private ways;
Thou know’st what ’tis my lips would
vent,
My yet unuttered word’s intent.

Surrounded by Thy power I stand,
On every side I find Thy hand:
O skill, for human reach too high!
Too dazzling bright for mortal eye!

Search, try, O GOD, my thought and
heart,
If mischief lurks in any part;
Correct me where I go astray,
And guide me in Thy perfect way.
