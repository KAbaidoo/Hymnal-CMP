HYMN 608 Burial of the Dead

GOD of the living, in whose eyes
Unveiled Thy whole creation lies;
All souls are thine; we must not say
That those are dead who pass away;
From this our world of flesh set free,
We know them living unto Thee.

Not spilt like water on the ground,
Not wrapped in dreamless sleep profound,
Not wandering in unknown despair,
Beyond Thy Voice, Thine Arm, Thy care;
Not left to lie like fallen tree,-
Not dead, but living unto Thee.

Thy word is true, Thy will is just;
To Thee we leave them, LORD, in trust;
And bless Thee for the love which gave
Thy SON to fill a human grave,
That none might fear that world to see,
Where all are living unto Thee.

O Giver unto man of breath,
O Holder of the keys of death,
O quickener of the life within,
Save us from death, the death of sin;
That body, soul, and SPIRIT be
Forever living unto Thee!
