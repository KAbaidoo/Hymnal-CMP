HYMN 20

At even ere the sun was set,
The sick, O LORD, around Thee lay
Oh, in what divers pains they met
Oh, with what joy they went away

Once more ‘tis even tide, and we
Oppressed with various ills draw near
What if Thy Form we cannot see
We know and feel that Thou art here.

O Saviour CHRIST, our woes dispel;
For some are sick, and some are sad,
And some have never loved Thee well,
And some have lost the love they had;

And some have found the world is vain,
Yet from the world they break not free;
And some have friends who give them pain,
Yet have not sought a friend in Thee;

And none, O LORD, have perfect rest,
And they, who fain would serve Thee best,
Are conscious most of wrong within….

O Saviour CHRIST, Thou too art Man;
Thou hast been troubled, tempted, tried;
Thy kind but searching glance can scan
The very wounds that shame would hide;

Thy touch has still its ancient power;
No word from Thee can fruitless fall,
Hear, in this solemn evening hour,
And in Thy mercy heal us all.
