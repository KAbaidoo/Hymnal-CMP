HYMN 616 Angels

Life and strength of all Thy servants, Brightness of the FATHER’s light;
Men with Angels, earth with Heaven,
In Thy praise their songs unite,

Thousand Thousand warrior prince
In thine Angel army stand;
Flames the victor cross before them, Grasp’d in Michael’s dauntless hand, Hurling back
from Heav’n the rebels
With the lifting of his sword,
In the might of GOD he tramples
On the Dragon’s head abhorred.

LORD of Angels, CHRIST, we pray
Bid them aid us in our strife, [Thee, Chase afar the hosts of evil,
Til we reach the land of life.

GOD the FATHER, GOD Immortal,
GOD the SON, for us Who died,
GOD the Comforter, the SPIRIT,
Evermore be glorified!
