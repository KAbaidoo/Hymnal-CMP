HYMN 541

We are soldiers of CHRIST, who is
mighty to save,
And His Banner the Cross is unfurled: We are pledged to be faithful and
steadfast and brave
Against Satan, the flesh, and the world.

We are brothers and comrades, we
stand side by side,
And our faith and our hope are the
same;
And we think of the Cross on which
JESUS has died,
When we bear the reproach of His Name.

At the font we were marked with the
Cross on our brow,
Of our grace and our calling the sign: And the weakest is strong to be true
to his vow,
For the armour we wear is Divine.

We will watch ready armed if the
Tempter draw near,
If he come with a frown or a smile:
we will heed not his threats, nor his flatteries hear,
Nor be taken by storm or by wile.

We will master the flesh, and its
longings restrain,
We will not be the bond-slaves of
The pure SPIRIT of GOD in our nature
shall reign,
And our SPIRITS their freedom shall win.

For the world’s love we live not, its hate we defy
And we will not be led by the throng;
We’ll be true to ourselves, to our
FATHER oh high,
And the bright world to which we belong.

Now let each cheer his comrade, let
hearts beat as one,
While we follow where CHRIST leads
“Twere dishonor to yield, or the
battle to shun,
We will fight, and will watch, and will pray.

Though the warfare be weary, the
trial be sore,
In the might of our GOD we will stand;
Oh! what joy to be crown’d and be
pure evermore,
In the peace of our own FATHERland.
