HYMN 399 
 
 When our heads are bowed with woe, When our bitter tears overflow, 
 When we mourn the lost, the dear, JESUS, SON of Mary, hear. 
  
 
 When the solemn death-bell tolls 
 For our own departed souls, 
 When our final doom is near, 
 JESU, SON of Mercy, hear. 
  
 
 Thou hast bowed the dying head, 
 Thou the blood of life hast shed, Thou hast filled a mortal bier; 
 JESU, SON of Mary, hear. 
  
 
 When the heart is sad within 
 With the thought of all its sin, 
 When the SPIRIT shrinks with fear, JESU, SON of Mary, hear. 
  
 
 Thou the shame, the grief, hast known, Though the sins were not thine own; 
 Thou hast deigned their load to bear; JESU, SON of Mary, hear.
