HYMN 775

JESUS! Name all names above,
JESUS, best and dearest,
JESUS, fount of perfect love,
Holiest, tenderest, nearest;
JESUS, source of grace completest, JESUS purest, JESUS sweetest,
JESUS, well of power divine,
Make me, keep me, seal me Thine.

JESUS, open me the gate,
That the robber entered,
Who in that most lost estate
Wholly on Thee ventured.
Thou whose wounds are ever pleading, And Thy Passion interceding, From my misery let me rise
To my home in Paradise.

JESUS, crowned with thorns for me, Scourged for my transgression,
Witnessing through agony
That Thy good confession;
JESUS, clad in purple raiment,
For my evil making payment,
Let not all Thy woe and pain
Let not Calvary be in vain.

When I reach death’s bitter sea, And its waves mount higher,
Earthly help forsaking me
As the storm draws nigher,
JESUS, leave me not to languish
Helpless, hopeless, full of anguish; JESUS, let me hear Thee say,
“Thou shalt be with Me today.”
