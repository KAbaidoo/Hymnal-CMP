HYMN 673

Come, Holy SPIRIT come,
Let Thy bright beams arise;
Dispel the sorrow from our minds, The darkness from our eyes.

Convince us of our sin,
Then lead to JESUS’ Blood;
And to our wondering view reveal The secret love of GOD.

Revive our drooping faith,
Our doubts and fears remove,
And kindly in our breasts the flame Of never-dying love.

Cheer our desponding hearts,
Thou heavenly Paraclete;
Give us to lie with humble hope At our Redeemer’s feet.

‘Tis thine to cleanse the heart, To sanctify the soul,
To pour fresh life through every part, And new create the whole.

Dwell, therefore, in our hearts, our minds from bondage free;
The new shall know, and praise, and The FATHER, SON, and Thee.
