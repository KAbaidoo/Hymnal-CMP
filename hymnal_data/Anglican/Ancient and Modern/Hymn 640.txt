HYMN 640 Advent

Come, Thou long-expected JESUS,
Born to set Thy people free;
From our fears and sins release us; Let us find our rest in Thee.

Israel’s strength and consolation, Hope of all the earth Thou art;
Dear Desire of every nation,
Joy of every longing heart.

Born Thy people to deliver;
Born a Child and yet a King;
Born to reign in us forever;
Now Thy gracious kingdom bring.

By Thy own eternal SPIRIT,
Rule in all our hearts alone:
By Thy all-sufficient merit,
Raise us to Thy glorious Throne.
