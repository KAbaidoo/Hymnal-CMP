HYMN 324

JESUS, gentlest SAVIOR,
Thou art in us now,
Fill us with Thy Goodness,
Till our hearts overflow.

Multiply our graces,
Chiefly love and fear
And, dear LORD, the chiefest, Grace to persevere,

Oh, how can we thank Thee
For a gift like this,
Gift that truly maketh
Heaven’s eternal bliss!

Ah! when wilt Thou always
Make our hearts Thy home?
We must wait for heaven;
Then the day will come.
