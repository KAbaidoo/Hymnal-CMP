HYMN 756 FOR MARTYRS

The triumphs of the Saints,
The toils they bravely bore
The love that never faints,
Their glory evermore,-
For these the Church today
Pours forth her joyous lay;
What victors wear so rich bay?

This clinging world of ill
Them and their works abhorred;
Its withering flowers still
They spurned with one accord;
They knew them short-lived all,
How soon they fade and fall,
And followed, JESU, at Thy call.

What tongue may here declare,
Fancy or Thought descry,
The joys Thou dost prepare
For these Thy Saints on high?
Empurpled in the flood
Of their victorious blood,
They won the laurel from their GOD.

O LORD most High, we pray,
Stretch forth Thy mighty arm
To put our sins away
And shelter us from harm;
O give Thy servants peace;
From guilt and pain release;
Our praise to Thee shall never cease.
