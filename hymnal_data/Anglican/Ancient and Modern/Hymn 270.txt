HYMN 270

Soldiers of CHRIST, arise,
And put your armor on;
Strong in the strength which GOD
Through His eternal SON;

Strong in the LORD of Hosts,
And in His mighty power;
Who in the strength of JESUS trusts
Is more than conqueror.

Stand then in His great might,
With all His strength endure;
And take, to arm you for the fight,
The panoply of GOD.

From strength to strength go on,
Wrestle, and fight, and pray;
Tread all the powers of darkness down,
And win the well-fought day.

That having all things done,
And all your conflicts past,
You may obtain, through CHRIST alone,
A crown of joy at last.

JESUS, Eternal SON,
We praise Thee and adore,
Who art with GOD the FATHER One
And SPIRIT evermore.
