HYMN 66
St. John the Evangelist’s Day

The life, which GOD’s incarnate
Lived here below with men,
Three blest Evangelists record
With Heav’n-inspired pen:

John soars on high, beyond the three,
To GOD the FATHER’s Throne;
And shows in what deep mystery
The word with GOD is One.

Upon the SAVIOUR’s loving Breast
Invited to recline,
‘twas thence he drew,
in moments Rich stores of truth Divine:

And then did that angelic love
His inmost SPIRIT fill,
Which, once enkindled from above
Breathes in his pages still.

JESU, the Virgin’s Holy SON,
We praise Thee and adore,
Who art with GOD the FATHER One
And Spirit evermore.
