HYMN 553

O Thou, who at Thy Eucharist
didst pray
That all Thy Church might be forever one, Grant us at every Eucharist to say
With longing heart and soul,
“Thy will be done,”
Oh, may we all one Bread, one Body be,
Through this blest Sacrament of Unity.

For all Thy Church, O LORD, we
intercede;
Make Thou our sad divisions soon to
cease;
Draw us the nearer each to each, we plead, By drawing all to Thee, O Prince of
peace;
Thus may we all one Bread, one Body be,
Through this blest Sacrament of Unity.

We pray Thee too for wanderers from
Thy Fold;
O bring them back, Good Shepherd of
the sheep,
Back to the Faith which Saints
believed of old,
Back to the Church which still that
faith doth keep;
Soon may we all one Bread, one
Body be,
Through this blest Sacrament of Unity.

So, LORD, at length when Sacraments
shall cease,
May we be one with all Thy Church above,
One with Thy Saints in one unbroken peace, One with Thy Saints in one unbounded love:
More blessed still, in peace and love
to be
One with the Trinity in Unity.
