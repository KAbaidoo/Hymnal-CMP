HYMN 34
Morning

On this day, the first of days,
GOD the FATHER’s Name we praise;
Who creation’s LORD and Spring,
Did the world from darkness bring.

On this day the Eternal SON
Over death His triumph won;
On this day the SPIRIT came
With His gifts of living flame.

O that fervent love today
May in every heart have sway,
Teaching us to praise aright
GOD the Source of life and light,

FATHER, who didst fashion me
Image of Thyself to be
Fill me with Thy love divine,
Let my every thought be thine,

Holy JESUS, may I be
Dead and buried here with Thee;
And, by love inflamed, arise
Unto Thee a sacrifice.

Thou who dost all gifts impart,
Shine, sweet SPIRIT, in my heart;
Best if gifts Thyself bestow;
Make me burn Thy love to know,

GOD, the blessed THREE in ONE,
Dwell within my heart alone;
Thou dost give Thyself to me,
May I give myself to Thee.
