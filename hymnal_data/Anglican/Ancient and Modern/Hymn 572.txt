HYMN 572 
 
 LORD, I would own Thy tender care And all Thy love to me; 
 The food I eat, the clothes I wear, Are all bestowed by Thee. 
  
 
 “Tis Thou preservest me from death And dangers every hour; 
 I cannot draw another breath 
 Unless Thou give me power. 
  
 
 King Angels guard me ever night. 
 As round my bed they stay; 
 Nor am I absent from Thy sight 
 In darkness or by day 
 My health, and friends, and parents To me by GOD are given; 
 I have not any blessing here 
 But what is sent from Heav’n. 
  
 
 Such goodness, LORD, and constant I never can repay; [care But may it be my daily 
prayer, 
 To love Thee and obey.
