HYMN 722

We hail Thee now, O JESUS,
Upon thine Altar-Throne,
Though sight and touch have failed
And faith perceives alone!
Thy love hath veiled Thy GODhead
And hid Thy power divine,
In mercy to our weakness,
Beneath an earthly sign.

We hail Thee now, O JESUS;
In silence hast Thou come;
For all the hosts of heaven
With wonderment are dumb;
So great the condescension,
So marvelous the love,
Which for our sakes, O SAVIOR, Have drawn Thee from above.

We hail Thee now, O JESUS;
For law and type have ceased,
And Thou in each Communion
Art Sacrifice and Priest;
We make this great memorial
In union, LORD, with Thee,
And plead Thy Death and Passion To cleanse and set us free.

We hail Thee now, O JESUS;
For death is drawing near,
And in Thy presence only
Its terrors disappear.

Dwell with us, sweetest SAVIOR, And guide us through the night, Till shadows end in glory,
And faith be lost in sight.
