HYMN 666

O FATHER, we would thank Thee
For all Thy love has given,
Our present joy of Sonship,
Our future joy in heaven;
The life which sin had blighted So wondrously restored
By our mysterious union
With JESUS CHRIST our LORD.

Rich gifts of life and gladness,-
A new and heav’nly birth,
Baptismal waters flowing
To cleanse the Sons of earth;
The strength in which to follow The steps that JESUS trod;
And love beyond all knowledge
Which calls us Sons of GOD.

O mercy all abundant
Bestowed on us to-day!
O hope of future glory
Which fadeth not away!

By GOD’s great love begotten
To living hope and sure,
May we at CHRIST’s appearing
Be pure as He is pure.

For all Thy gifts, O FATHER,
Our hymns of praise arise,-
The love which calls us children, The hope which purifies;
The grace by which we offer
A service glad and free;
The earnest of perfection,
Of fuller life with Thee.
