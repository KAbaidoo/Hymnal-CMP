HYMN 18

HAIL, gladdening Light, of His pure 
glory poured Who is the Immortal FATHER, 
heavenly, Blest, Holiest of Holies, 
JESUS CHRIST, our LORD.

Now we are come to the sun’s hour of rest,
The lights of evening round us shine 
We hymn the FATHER, SON, and  HOLY SPIRIT Divine, 
Worthiest art Thou at all times to be sung 
With undefiled tongue,

SON of our GOD, Giver of life, Alone! 
Therefore in all the world Thy 
glories, LORD, they own.
