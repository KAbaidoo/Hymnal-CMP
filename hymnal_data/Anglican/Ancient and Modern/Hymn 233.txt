HYMN 233

Jerusalem on high
My song and city is,
My home whenever I die,
The center of my bliss:
O happy place!
When shall I be, my God, with Thee, to see Thy face?

There dwells my Lord, my King
Judged here unfit to live;
There angels to Him sing,
And lowly homage give:
O happy place!
When shall I be, my God, with Thee, to see Thy face?

The patriarchs of old
There from their travels cease;
The prophets there behold
Their longed-for Prince of peace:
O happy place!
When shall I be, my God, with Thee, to see Thy face?

The Lamb's apostles there
In might with joy behold,
The harpers I might hear
Harping on harps of gold:
O happy place!
When shall I be, my God, with Thee, to see Thy face?

The bleeding martyrs, they
Within these courts are found,
Clothed in pure array,
Their scars with glory crowned:
O happy place!
When shall I be, my God, with Thee, to see Thy face?

Ah me! Ah me! that I
In Kedar's tents here stay:
No place like that on high;
Lord, thither guide my way:
O happy place!
When shall I be, my God, with Thee, to see Thy face?
