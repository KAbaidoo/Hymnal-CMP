HYMN 239

CHRIST is our cornerstone,
On Him alone we build;
With His true Saints alone
The courts of heaven are filled:
On His great love Our hopes we place Of present grace And joys above.

Oh, then with hymns of praise
These hallowed courts shall ring;
Our voices we will raise
The THREE in ONE to sing;
And thus proclaim In joyful Song, Both loud and long, That glorious Name.

Here, gracious GOD, do Thou
Forever more draw nigh;
Accept each faithful vow,
And hark each suppliant sigh;
In copious shower On all who pray Each holy day Thy blessings pour.

Here may we gain from heaven
The grace which we implore,
And may that grace, once given,
But with us evermore,
Until that day When all the blest To endless rest Are called away.
