HYMN 33 
 Sunday Morning 
 
 Morn of morns, and day of days! 
 Beauteous were Thy new born rays; 
 Brighter ye from death’s dark prison 
 CHRIST, the Light of lights, is risen, 
 He commanded, and His Word
 
 Death and the dread chaos heard: 
 Oh, shall we, more deaf than they, 
 In the chains of darkness stay? 
 Nature yet in shadow lies; 
 Let the Sons of light arise, 
 And prevent the morning rays 
 With sweet canticles of praise. 
  
 
 While the dead world sleeps around, 
 Let the sacred temples sound 
 Law, and prophet, and blest psalm 
 Lit with holy light so calm. 
  
 
 Unto hearts in slumber weak 
 Let the heavenly trumpet speak; 
 And power walk express 
 Their new life to righteousness 
  
 
 Grant us this, and with us be, 
 O Thou fount of charity 
 Thou who dost the SPIRIT give 
 Bidding the dead letter live 
  
 
 Glory to the FATHER, SON, 
 And to Thee, O holy One, 
 By whose quickening breath divine 
 Our dull SPIRITS burn and shine
