HYMN 263

Take up Thy cross, the SAVIOR said, If Thou wouldst my disciple be;
Deny Thyself, the world forsake,
And humbly follow after me.

Take up Thy cross; let not its weight Fill Thy weak SPIRIT with alarm:
His strength shall bear Thy SPIRIT up, and brace Thy heart, and nerve
thine arm.

Take up Thy cross, nor heed the shame, Nor let Thy foolish pride rebel;
Thy LORD for Thee the Cross endured, To save Thy soul from death and hell.

Take up Thy cross then in His strength And calmly every danger brave;
'Twill guide Thee to a better home,
And lead to victory o'er the grave.

Take up Thy cross, and follow CHRIST
Nor think till death to lay it down; For only he who bears the cross
May hope to wear the glorious crown.

To Thee, Great LORD, the One in Three, All praise for evermore ascend;
O grant us in our Home to see
The heavenly life that knows no end.
