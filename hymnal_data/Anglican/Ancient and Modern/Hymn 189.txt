HYMN 189

JESUS, Thy mercies are untold
Through each returning day;
Thy love exceeds a Thousand-fold
Whatever we can say;

That love which in Thy passion
For us Thy precious Blood drained
That love whereby the saints have
The vision of their GOD.

'Tis Thou has loved us from the
Pure source of all our bliss,
Our only hope of life to come,
Our happiness in this.

LORD, grant us while on earth we
Thy love to feel and know,
And, when from hence we pass away,
To us Thy glory show.
