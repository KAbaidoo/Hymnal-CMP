HYMN 605 Meetings

O LORD, our strength in weakness, We pray to Thee for grace;
For power to fight the battle,
For speed to run the race;
When Thy baptismal waters
Were poured upon our brow,
We then were made Thy children, And pledged our earliest vow.

CHRIST with His own Blood bought And made the purchase sure; 
He keeps us
Sober, and chaste, and pure.
He, GOD in Man, has carried
Our nature up to Heaven;
To dwell in us has given.

Conformed to His own likeness,
May we so live and die,
That in the grave our bodies
In holy peace may lie;
And at the Resurrection
Forth from those graves may spring Like to the glorious Body
Of CHRIST, our LORD and King

The pure in heart are blessed,
For they shall see the LORD,
Forever and forever
By Seraphim adored;
And they shall drink the pleasures, Such as no tongue can tell,
From the clear crystal river,
And Life’s eternal well.

Sing therefore to the FATHER,
Who sent the SON in love,
And sing to GOD the SAVIOUR,
Who leads to realms above;
Sing we with saints and Angels
Before the Heavenly Throne,
To GOD the Holy SPIRIT;
Sing to the THREE in ONE.
