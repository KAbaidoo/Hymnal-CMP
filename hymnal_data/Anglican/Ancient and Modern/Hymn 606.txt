HYMN 606

O FATHER, in Whose great design
Our human love is made Divine,
Teach us to give our love to those
By sin beset and all its woes,
On Thee for them to cast our care,
By fasting and by lowly prayer.

LORD JESUS, grant us eyes to see
In our poor brethren thine and Thee—
To give ourselves where others need;
Where others sin to intercede;
And thus, by fasting and by prayer,
Our brethren’s burden seek to bear.

O SPIRIT, by whose grace alone
The many members are made one;
O warm our hearts, inspire our will,
That we Thy purpose may fulfill;
And thus, by fasting and by prayer
Through Thee “the glorious
Church” prepare.

O GOD, All-loving THREE in ONE,
Whom we shall see beyond the sun;
Where walk in white the blood—
bought throng,
Where soars to Thee the sweet new
Song,
Grant that we find the brethren there
We sought by fasting and by prayer.
