HYMN 325 Holy Baptism

O FATHER, Thou who hast created
In wisest love, we pray,
Look on this babe, who at Thy
gracious call Is entering on life’s way;
Bend o’er him in Thy tenderness,
Thine image on his soul impress;
O FATHER, hear!

O SON of GOD, who diedst for us
behold,
We bring our child to Thee;
Thou tender shepherd, take him to
Thine own for aye to be;
Defend him through this earthly
strife,
And lead him on the path of life,
O SON of GOD!

O HOLY GHOST, who brooded o’er
the wave,
Descend upon this child;
Give him undying life, his SPIRIT lave
With waters undefiled;
Grant him, while yet a babe to be
A child of GOD, a home for Thee,
O HOLY GHOST!

O Triune GOD, what Thou command’st is done;
We speak, but thine the might;
This child has scarce yet seen our
earthly sun, Yet pour on him Thy light,
In faith and hope, in joy and love, Thou Sun of all below, above,
O Triune GOD!
