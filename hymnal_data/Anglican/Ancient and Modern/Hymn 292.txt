HYMN 292

Praise the LORD! ye heavens, adore Him,
Praise Him, Angels, in the height; Sun and moon, rejoice before Him,
Praise Him, all ye stars and light: Praise the LORD! for HE hath
Spoken,
Worlds His mighty voice obey’d:
Laws, which never shall be broken, For their guidance HE hath made.

Praise the LORD! for He is glorious; Never shall His promise fail;
GOD hath made His Saints victorious, Sin and death shall not prevail.
Praise the GOD of our salvation;
Hosts on high, His power proclaim; Heav’n and earth, and all creation, Laud and magnify His Name!
