HYMN 147

Hail the day that sees Him rise
  Alleluia!
To His Throne above the skies:
  Alleluia!
CHRIST, the lamb for sinners given, Alleluia!
Enters now the highest Heav’n,
  Alleluia!
There for Him high triumph waits;
  Alleluia!
Lift your heads, eternal gates;
  Alleluia!
He hath conquer’d death and sin:
  Alleluia!
Take the King of glory in
  Alleluia!
Lo! The heav’n its LORD receives,
  Alleluia!
Yet He loves the earth He
  Alleluia! leaves Though returning to His Throne,
  Alleluia!
Still He calls mankind His own,
  Alleluia!
See! He lifts His hand above:
  Alleluia!
See! He shows the prints of love
  Alleluia!
Hark! His gracious lips bestow
  Alleluia!
Blessings on His church below,
  Alleluia!
Still for us He intercedes,
  Alleluia!
His prevailing Death He pleads,
  Alleluia!
Near Himself prepares our place,
  Alleluia!
He the first-fruits of our race.
  Alleluia!
LORD, Thou parted from our sight,
  Alleluia!
Far above the starry height,
  Alleluia!
Grant our hearts may thither rise,
  Alleluia!
Seeking Thee above the skies,
  Alleluia!
