HYMN 580 Meeting

Shine Thou upon us, LORD,
True Light of men, today;
And through the written word
Thy very self display;
That so from hearts which burn
With gazing on Thy face,
The little ones may learn
The wonders of Thy grace.

Breathe Thou upon us, LORD,
Thy SPIRIT’s living flame,
That so with one accord
Our lips may tell Thy Name;
Give Thou the hearing ear,
Fix Thou the wandering thought,
That those we teach may hear
The great things Thou hast wrought.

Speak Thou for us, O LORD,
In all we say of Thee;
According to Thy Word
Let all our teaching be;
That so Thy lambs may know
Their own true Shepherd’s voice,
Where’er He leads them go,
And in His love rejoice.

Live Thou within us, LORD:
Thy mind and will be ours;
Be Thou beloved, adored,
And serve, with all our powers:
That so our lives may teach
Thy children what Thou art,
And plead, by more than speech,
For Thee with every heart.
