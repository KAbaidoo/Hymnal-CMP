HYMN 308

O Praise ye the LORD!
Praise Him in the height;
Rejoice in His Word,
Ye Angels of light;
Ye heavens, adore Him
By Whom ye were made,
And worship before Him,
In brightness arrayed,

O praise ye the LORD!
Praise Him upon earth,
In tuneful accord,
Ye Sons of new birth;
Praise Him who hath brought you His grace from above,
Praise Him who hath taught you To sing of His love.

O Praise ye the LORD,
All things that give sound Each jubilant chord,
Re-echo around;
Loud organs, His glory
Forth tell in deep tone,
And sweet harp, the story
Of what He hath done.

O praise ye the LORD!
Thanksgiving and Song
To Him be outpoured
All ages along;
For love in creation,
For heaven restored,
For grace of salvation
O praise ye the LORD!
