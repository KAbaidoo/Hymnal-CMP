HYMN 309 Holy Communion

Now, my tongue, the mystery tell—
Of the glorious Body singing
And the Blood, all price excelling,
Which the Gentiles’
LORD and King,
In a Virgin’s womb once dwelling,
Shed for this world’s ransoming.

Given for us, and condescending
To be born for us below,
He, with me in converse bleeding,
Dwelt the seed of truth to show,
Til He closed with wondrous ending His most patient life of woe.

That last night, at supper lying
“Mild the Twelve, His chosen band, JESUS, with the law complying,
Keeps the feast its rites demand;
Then, more precious Food supplying, Gives Himself with His own Hand.

Word-made-Flesh true bread He
maketh
By His Word His Flesh to be;
Wine His Blood: which whose
taketh
Must from carnal Thoughts be free: Faith alone, Though sight forsaketh, Shows true
hearts the mystery.

Part 2
Therefore we, before Him bending
This great sacrament reve’ e; [ing, Types and shadows have their end—
for the newer rite is here;
Faith, our outward sense befriending Makes our inward vision clear.

Glory let us give, and blessing
To the FATHER, and the SON,
Honour, might, and praise addressing, While eternal ages run;
Ever too His love confessing,
Who from both with both is One.
