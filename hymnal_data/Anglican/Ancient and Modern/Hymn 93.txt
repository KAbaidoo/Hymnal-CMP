HYMN 93

O LORD, turn not Thy face from me,
Who lie in woeful state,
Lamenting all my sinful life
Before Thy mercy-gate;

A gate which opens wide to those
That do lament their sin;
Shut not that gate against me,
LORD, But let me enter in.

And call me not to strict account
How I have sojourned here;
For then my guilty conscience knows
How vile I shall appear.

Mercy, Good LORD, mercy I ask;
This is my humble prayer;
For mercy, LORD is all my suit,
O let Thy mercy spare.
