HYMN 505 Rogation Days

O Throned, O crown'd with all renown,
Since Thou the earth hast trod,
Thou reignest, and by Thee come
Henceforth the gifts of GOD.
By Thee the suns of space, that burn
Unspent, their watches hold;
The hosts that turn, and still return,
Are sway'd, and poised, and roll'd.

The powers of earth, for all her ills,
An endless treasure yield;
The precious things of the ancient
Forest, and fruitful field.
Thine is the health, and thine the wealth
That in our halls abound;
And thine the beauty and the joy
With which the years are crown'd.

And as, when ebbed the flood, our sires
Kneel'd o'er the new world's altar fires
Shone out the bow of GOD;
And sweetly fell the peaceful spell-
Word that shall aye avail-
"Summer and winter shall not cease,
Seedtime nor harvest fail."

Thus in their change let frost and heat
And winds and dews be given;
All fostering power, all influence sweet,
Breathe from the bounteous heaven.
A temper fair with gentle air
The sunshine and the rain,
That kindly earth with timely birth
May yield her fruits again;

That we may feed Thy poor aright,
And, gathering round Thy Throne,
Here in the holy Angels' sight
Repay the of thine own.
For so our sires in olden time
Spared neither gold nor gear,
Nor precious wood, nor hewen stone,
Thy sacred shrines to rear.

For thereto give the second birth
In mysteries and signs,
The face of CHRIST o'er all the earth
On kneeling myriads shines.

And if so fair beyond compare
Thine earthly houses be,
In how great grace shall we Thy face
In thine own Palaces see?
