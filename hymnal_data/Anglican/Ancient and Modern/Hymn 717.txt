HYMN 717

Not a thought of earthly things!
Every head in awe be bended:
CHRIST our GOD, the King of kings, Comes by angel troops attended.

Forth He comes, a victim He
For the wide world’s need availing, And His people’s food to be,
With Himself their souls regaling.

Cherubim with watchful eyes,
Seraphim their brows concealing,
Powers and Principalities,
Cry aloud, like thunder pealing.
