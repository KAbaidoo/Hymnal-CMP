HYMN 163

THREE in ONE, and One in Three,
Ruler of the earth and sea,
Hear us, while we lift to Thee
Holy chant and psalm.

Light of lights! With morning shine; Lift on us Thy Light Divine;
And let charity benign
Breathe on us her balm.

Light of lights! when falls the even, Let it close on sin forgiven;
Fold us in the peace of Heav’n;
Shed a holy calm.

THREE in ONE, and One in Three,
Dimly here we worship Thee;
With the Saints hereafter we
Hope to bear the palm.
