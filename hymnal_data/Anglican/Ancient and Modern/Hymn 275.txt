HYMN 275

FATHER of all, from land and sea
The nations sing, “Thine, LORD
are we,
Countless in number, but in Thee
May we be one.

O SON of GOD, Whose love so free
For men did make Thee man to be,
United to our GOD in Thee
May we be one.

Thou, LORD, didst once for all atone; Thee may both Jew and Gentile own
Of their two walls the cornerstone,
Making them one.

In Thee we are GOD’s Israel,
Thou art the world’s Emmanuel,
In Thee the Saints forever dwell,
Millions, but one.

Thou art the Fountain of all good,
Cleansing with Thy most precious
Blood,
And feeding us with Angels’ Food,
Making us one.

Join high and low, join young and
IN love that never waxes cold; [old Under one Shepherd, in one fold,
Make us all one, [love;
O Trinity in Unity,
One only GOD, in Persons three,
Dwell ever in our hearts; like Thee
May we be one.

So, when the world shall pass away,
May we awake with joy and say,
“Now in the bliss of endless day
We all are one.
