HYMN 8

Forth in Thy Name, O LORD I go,
My daily labor to pursue;
Thee, only Thee, resolved to know,
In all I think or speak, or do.

The task Thy wisdom hath assigned
O let me cheerfully fulfill;
In all my works Thy presence find,
And prove Thy good and perfect will

Thee may I set at my right hand,
Whose eyes my inmost substance see,
And labor on at Thy command,
And offer all my works to Thee.

Give me to bear Thy easy yoke,
And every moment watch and pray,
And still to things eternal look
And hasten to Thy glorious day;

For Thee delightfully employ
Whate’er Thy bounteous grace hath given,
And run my course with even joy,
And closely walk with Thee to Heav’n.
