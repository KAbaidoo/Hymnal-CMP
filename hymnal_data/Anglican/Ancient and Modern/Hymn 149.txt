HYMN 149

Thou art gone up on high,
To mansions in the skies;
And round Thy Throne unceasingly The songs of praise arise;
But we are lingering here,
With sin and care oppressed
LORD, send Thy promised comforter, And lead us to Thy rest.

Thou art gone up on high;
But Thou didst first come down
Through earth’s most bitter misery To pass unto Thy Crown;
And girt with griefs and fears
Our onward course must be;
But only let this path of tears
lead us at last to Thee.

Thou art gone up on high;
But Thou shalt come again,
With all the bright ones of the sky Attendant in Thy train.
LORD, by Thy saving power
So make us live and die,
That we may stand in that dread hour
At Thy right Hand on high.
