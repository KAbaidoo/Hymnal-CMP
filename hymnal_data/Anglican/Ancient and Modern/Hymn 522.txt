HYMN 522

O for a Thousand tongues to sing
My blest redeemer’s praise,
The glories of my GOD and King,
The triumphs of His grace!

JESUS – the Name that charms our
fears,
That bids our sorrows cease;
‘Tis music in the sinner’s ears,
‘Tis life, and health, and peace.

He speaks; - and, listening to His Voice
The mournful broken hearts rejoice,
The humble poor believe.

Hear Him, ye deaf; His praise, ye dumb,
Your loosened tongues employ;
Ye blind, behold your SAVIOUR come;
And leap, ye lame, for joy!

My gracious Master and my GOD,
Assist me to proclaim abroad
And spread through all the earth
The honors of Thy Name.
