HYMN 83
Septuagesima

Creator of the world, to Thee
And endless rest of joy belongs;
And heavenly choirs are ever free
To sing on high their festal songs.

But we are fallen creatures here,
Where pain and sorrow daily come;
And how can we in exile drear
Sing out as they, sweet songs of
Home?

O FATHER, who dost promise still
That they who mourn shall blessed be,
Grant us to weep for deeds of ill
That banish us so long from Thee;

But, weeping, grant us faith to rest
In hope upon Thy loving care;
Till Thou restore us, with the blest,
Their songs of praise in Heav’n to share.

To FATHER, SON, and HOLY GHOST
The GOD whom heav’n and earth adore,
From men and from the Angel host
Be praise the glory evermore.

From Septuagesima Sunday to
Lent the Hymns for Sunday and the
Other days of the week should be sung.
