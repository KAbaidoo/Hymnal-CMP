HYMN 278

O For a faith that will not shrink, Though pressed by many a foe;
That will not tremble on the brink Of poverty or woe;

That will not murmur nor complain Beneath the chastening rod;
But in the hour of grief or pain Can lean upon its GOD;

A faith that shines more bright and clear
When tempests rage without;
That when in danger knows no fear, In darkness feels no doubt;

A faith that keeps that narrow way Til life’s last spark is fled, And with a pure and
heavenly ray Lights up the dying bed.

LORD, give me such a faith as this, And then, whate’er may come,
I taste even now the hallowed bliss Of an eternal home.
