HYMN 726 For the Young

I was made a Christian
When my name was given,
And an heir of heaven,
In the name of Christian
I will glory now,
Evermore remember
My baptismal vow.

I must, like a Christian,
Shun all evil ways,
Keep the faith of JESUS,
Serve Him all my days.
Called to be a Christian,
I will praise the LORD,
Seek for His assistance
So to keep my word.

All a Christian’s blessings I will claim for mine:
Holy work and worship,
Fellowship divine.
FATHER, SON, and SPIRIT,
Give me grace, that I
Still may live a Christian, And a Christian die.
