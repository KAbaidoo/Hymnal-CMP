HYMN 711 FOR A PROCESSION

Christians, sing the Incarnation
Of th’ eternal SON of GOD,
Who, to save us, took our nature,
Soul and body, flesh and blood:
GOD, He saw man’s cruel bondage,
Who in death’s dark dungeon lay;
Man, He came to fight man’s battle,
And for man He won the day.
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
To th’ incarnate SON of GOD,
Who for man as Man hath conquer’d
In our own true flesh and blood.

King of kings and LORD of Angels,
He put off His glory-crown
Had a stable-cave for palace,
And a manger for His Throne;
All its life and being owed,
And the lowly Hebrew Maiden
Was the Mother of her GOD:
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
To th’ incarnate SON of GOD,
Who conceal’d His dazzling GOD—
Head
‘Neath the veil of flesh and blood.

Through a life of lowly labour
He on earth was pleased to dwell,
All our want and sorrow sharing,
GOD with us, Emmanuel:
Yet a dearer, closer union
JESUS in His love would frame;
He, the Pasover fulfilling,
Gave Himself as Paschal Lamb.
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
To th’ incarnate SON of GOD,
Who the heav’nly gifts bequeath’d us
Of His own true Flesh and Blood.

Then, by man refused and hated,
GOD for man vouchsafed to die,
Love divine its depth revealing
On the heights of Calvary;
Through His dying the dominion
From the tyrant death was torn
When its Victim rose it Victor
On the Resurrection morn,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
To th’ Incarnate SON of GOD,
Who through His eternal SPIRIT
Offer His own flesh and blood.

Forty days of mystic converse
Lived on earth the Risen One,
Speaking of His earthly kingdom,
Ere He sought His heav’nly Throne:
Then, His latest words a blessing,
He ascended upon high,
And through rank on rank of Angels
Captive led captivity.
Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
To th’ Incarnate SON of GOD,
Who the Holiest place hath enter’d
In our flesh and by His blood.

Now upon the golden altar,
In the midst before the Throne,
Incense of His intercession
He is offering for His own.
And on earth at all His altars
His true presence we adore,
And His Sacrifice is pleaded,
Year, till time shall be no more.
Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
To th’ Incarnate SON of GOD,
Who abiding Priest forever,
Still imparts His Flesh and Blood.
