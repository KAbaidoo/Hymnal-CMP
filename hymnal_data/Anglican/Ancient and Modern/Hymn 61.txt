HYMN 61

Christians, awake, salute the happy morn,
Where on the SAVIOUR of the world was born;
Rise to adore the mystery of love,
Which hosts of Angels chanted from above;
With them the joyful tidings first begun
Of GOD incarnate and the Virgin’s SON.

Then to the watchful shepherds it was told,
Who heard the Angelic herald’s voice,
“Behold, I bring good tidings of a SAVIOUR’s birth
To you and all the nations upon earth;
This day hath GOD fulfilled His promised word,
This day is born a SAVIOUR, CHRIST the LORD.

He spake; and straightway the celestial choir
In Hymns of joy, unknown before conspire;
The praises of redeeming love they sang,
And Heav’n orb with Alleluias rang:
GOD’s highest glory was their anthem still,
Peace upon earth, and unto men goodwill.

To Bethlehem straight the enlightened shepherds ran,
To see the wonder GOD had wrought for man,
And found, with Joseph and the Blessed maid,
Her SON, the SAVIOUR, in a manger laid;
Then to their flocks, still praising GOD, return,
And their glad hearts with holy rapture burn.

O may we, keeping and pondering in our mind
GOD’s wondrous love in saving lost mankind;
Trace we the Babe, who hath retrieved our loss,
His poor manger to His bitter cross;
Tread in His steps, assisted by His grace
Till man’s first heavenly state again takes place.

Then may we hope, the Angelic hosts among,
To sing, redeemed, a glad triumphal Song:
He that was born upon this joyful day
Around us all His glory shall display;
Saved by His love, incessant we shall sing
Eternal praise to Heav’n’s Almighty King.
