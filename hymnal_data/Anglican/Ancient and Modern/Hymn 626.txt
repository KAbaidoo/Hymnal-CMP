HYMN 626 and Instructions

Approach, my soul, the mercy-seat.
Where JESUS answers prayer:
There humbly fall before His feet, For none can perish there.

Thy promise is my only plea,
With this I venture nigh:
Thou callest burdened souls to Thee, And such, O LORD, am I.

Bowed down beneath a load of sin, By Satan sorely pressed,
By war without, and fears within, I come to Thee for rest.

Be Thou my shield and hiding
Place,
That, sheltered near Thy side
I may my fierce accuser face,
And tell him, Thou hast died.

O wondrous love, to bleed and die, To bear the Cross and shame,
That guilty sinners, such as I,
Might plead Thy gracious Name!
