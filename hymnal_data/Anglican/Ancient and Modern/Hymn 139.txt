HYMN 139

Come see the place where JESUS lay, And hear Angelic watchers say,
“He lives, who once was slain:
Why seek the living ‘midst the dead?
Remember how the SAVIOUR said
That He would rise again.”

O joyful sound! O glorious hour.
When by His own Almighty power
He rose, and left the grave!
Now let our songs His triumph tell, Who burst the bands of death and
And ever lives to save.

The first-begotten of the dead
For us He rose, our glorious head,
Immortal life to bring:
What Though the saints like Him shall die,
They share their Leader’s victory,
And triumph with their King.

No more they tremble at the grave,
For JESUS will their SPIRITs save,
And raise their slumbering dust;
O risen LORD, in Thee we live,
To Thee our ransom’d souls we give, To Thee our bodies trust.
