HYMN 227

For Thee, O dear, dear country, Mine eyes their vigils keep;
The mention of Thy glory
Is unction to the breast,
And medicine in sickness,
And love, and life, and rest.

O one, O only mansion!
O paradise of joy!
Where tears are ever banished
And smiles have no alloy;
The Lamb is all Thy splendor; The crucified Thy praise;
His laud and benediction
Thy ransomed people raise.

With jasper glow Thy bulwarks, Thy streets with emerald blaze; The sardius and the
topaz
Unite in Thee their rays;
Thine ageless walls are bonded With amethyst unpriced;
The Saints build up Thy fabric, And the cornerstone is CHRIST.

Thou hast no shore, fair ocean!
Thou hast no time, bright day!
Dear fountain of refreshment
To pilgrims far away!
Upon the Rock of ages
They raise Thy holy tower;
Thine is the victor’s laurel,
And thine the golden dower.

O sweet and blessed country,
The home of GOD’s elect!
O sweet and blessed country,
That eager hearts expect!
JESUS, in mercy bring us
To that dear land of rest;
Who art, with GOD the FATHER
And SPIRIT, ever blest.
