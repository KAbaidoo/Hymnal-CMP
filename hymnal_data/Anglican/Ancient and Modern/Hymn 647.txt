HYMN 647 HOLY WEEK

LORD, through this Holy Week of
our salvation,
Which Thou hast won for us who
went astray,
In all the conflict of Thy sore tempta—
We would continue with Thee day by
day.

We would not leave Thee, Though
our weak endurance
Make us unworthy here to take our
part;
Yet give us strength to trust the
sweet assurance
That Thou O LORD, art greater than
our heart.

Thou didst forgive thine own who
slept for sorrow,
Thou didst have pity, O have pity
now
And let us watch through each sad
eve and morrow
With Thee, in holy prayer and
solemn vow.

Along that sacred way where Thou
art leading,
Which Thou didst take to save our
souls from loss,
Let us go also, till we see Thee
In all-prevailing prayer upon Thy
cross;

Until Thou see Thy bitter travail’s
ending,
The world redeemed, the will of GOD
complete,
And, to Thy FATHER’s hands Thy
soul commending
Thou lay the work He gave Thee at
His feet.
