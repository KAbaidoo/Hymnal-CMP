Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hearts to Heaven and voices raise;
Sing to GOD a hymn of gladness,
Sing to GOD a hymn of praise;
He, who on the cross a victim
For the world’s salvation bled,
JESUS CHRIST, the King of glory,
Now is risen from the dead.

CHRIST is risen, CHRIST the first-fruits of the holy harvest field,
Which with all its full abundance
At His second coming yield;
Then the golden ears of harvest will
Their heads before Him wave,
Ripened by His glorious sunshine,
From the furrows of the grave.

CHRIST is risen, we are risen; shed
Upon us heavenly grace,
Rain, and dew, and gleams of glory
From the brightness of Thy face;
That we, with our hearts in heaven,
Here on earth may fruitful be,
And by Angel-hands be gathered,
And be ever, LORD, with Thee.

Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Glory be to GOD
On high;
Hallelujah to the SAVIOUR, who has
Gained the victory;
Hallelujah to the SPIRIT, fount of love and sanctity:
Hallelujah! Hallelujah! To the triune Majesty.
