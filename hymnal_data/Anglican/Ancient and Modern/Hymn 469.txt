HYMN 469 Glorified

GOD the FATHER, Throned on high,
SAVIOUR, who didst come to die,
SPIRIT, who dost sanctify,
Save us, Holy Trinity.

JESU, Prince of life and light,
Dwelling now in glory bright,
Ruling all things by Thy might,
Hear us, Holy JESU.

Thou whose death did death destroy,
Who through pain didst pass to joy
Endless and without alloy,
Hear us, Holy JESU.

Thou who didst to Heav’n ascend
Still to be the sinner’s friend,
Still Thy people to defend,
Hear us, Holy JESU.

JESU, raised to GOD’s right hand,
Round whose Throne the Angel band
Waits Thy Word of dread command,
Hear us, Holy JESU.

Thou who dost the scepter bear,
And in Heav’n a place prepare
That we may be with Thee there,
Hear us, Holy JESU.

Thou who must in glory reign,
Conqueror of sin and pain,
Till no enemy remain,
Hear us, Holy JESU.

JESU, who art glorified
In the very flesh that died,
With the pierced hands and side,
Hear us, Holy JESU.

JESU, Though enthroned on high,
Still for our infirmity
Touch’d with human sympathy,
Hear us, Holy JESU.

JESU, in our time of need
Our High priest to intercede,
Living still Thy death to plead,
Hear us, Holy JESU.

JESU, able to bestow
On Thy struggling church below
More than we can ask or know,
Hear us, Holy JESU.

JESU, who to heav’n upborne
Didst not leave Thy church to mourn
Orphan’d, comfortless, forlorn.
