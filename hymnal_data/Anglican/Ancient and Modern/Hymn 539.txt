HYMN 539

Take not thought for food or
Careful one, so anxiously:
For the King Himself provideth
Food and clothes for Thee.

He who daily feeds the sparrow,
He who clothes the lilies bright,
More than birds and flowers holds
Precious in His sight.

Wouldst Thou give a stone, a
serpent
To Thy pleading child for food?
And shall not Thy Heavenly FATHER
Give Thee what is good?

One the heart that careth for Thee
Rest Thou then from sorrow free;
For of all most tender FATHERs
None so good as He.

Seek Thou first His gracious promise,
Treasure stored in Heav’n above;
So Thou mayst entrust all other
Safely to His love.

Unto Thee, O bounteous FATHER,
Glory, honour, praise be done;
With the SON and Holy SPIRIT,
GOD for ever One.
