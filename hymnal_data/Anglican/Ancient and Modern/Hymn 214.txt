HYMN 214

LORD of our life, and GOD of our salvation,
Star of our night, and Hope of every nation,
Hear and receive Thy Church’s supplication,
LORD GOD Almighty.

See round thine ark the hungry billows curling:
See how Thy foes their banners are unfurling;
LORD, while their darts envenomed they are hurling,
Thou canst preserve us.

LORD, Thou canst help when earthly armor faileth,
LORD, Thou canst save when deadly sin assaileth,
LORD o’er Thy church nor death nor hell prevaileth,
Grant us Thy peace, LORD.

Grant us Thy help till foes are backward driven,
Grant them Thy truth, that they may be forgiven,
Grant peace on earth, and, after we have striven,
Peace in Thy Heav’n.
