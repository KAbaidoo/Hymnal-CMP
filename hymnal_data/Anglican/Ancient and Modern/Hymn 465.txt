HYMN 465 No 1 PART 1
GOD the FATHER, GOD the SON,
GOD the SPIRIT, THREE in ONE,
Hear us from Thy heavenly Throne,
Spare us, Holy Trinity.

FATHER, hear Thy children's call:
Humbly at Thy feet we fall,
Prodigals, confessing all
We beseech Thee, hear us.

CHRIST, beneath Thy cross we blame
All our life of sin and shame,
Penitent we breathe Thy Name:
We beseech Thee, hear us.

Holy SPIRIT, grieved and tried,
Often forgotten and defied,
Now we mourn our stubborn pride:
We beseech Thee, hear us.

Love, that caused us first to be,
Love that bled upon the tree,
Love, that draws us lovingly:
We beseech Thee, hear us.

We Thy call have disobeyed,
Into paths of sin have strayed
And repentance have delayed:
We beseech Thee, hear us.

Sick, we come to Thee for cure,
Guilty, seek Thy mercy sure,
Evil, long to be made pure:
We beseech Thee, hear us.

Blind, we pray that we may see,
Bound, we pray to be made free,
Stained, we pray for sanctity:
We beseech Thee, hear us.

Thou who hear'st each contrite sigh,
Bidding sinful souls draw nigh,
Willing not that one should die,
We beseech Thee, hear us.

PART 2
By the gracious saving call
Spoken tenderly to all
Who have shared in Adam's fall,
We beseech Thee, hear us.

By the nature JESUS wore,
By the Stripes and Death He bore,
By His Life forevermore,
We beseech Thee, hear us.
