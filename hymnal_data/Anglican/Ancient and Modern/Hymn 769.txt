HYMN 769

I lay my sins on JESUS,
The spotless Lamb of GOD,
He bears them all, and frees us From the accursed load,
I bring my guilt to JESUS,
To wash my crimson stains
White in His Blood most precious.
Till not a spot remains.

I lay my wants on JESUS;
All fullness dwells in Him;
He heals all my diseases,
He doth my soul redeem.

I lay my griefs on JESUS,
My burdens and my cares;
He from them all releases,
Heal my sorrow shares.

I rest my soul on JESUS,
This weary soul of mine;
His Right Hand me embraces,
I on His Breast recline.
I love the Name of JESUS,
Immanuel, CHRIST, the LORD;
Like fragrance on the breezes
His Name abroad is poured.

I long to be like JESUS,
Meek, loving, lowly, mild:
I long to be like JESUS,
The FATHER’s holy Child:
I long to be with JESUS,
Amid the heavenly throng;
To sing with saints His praises, To learn the Angels’ Song.
