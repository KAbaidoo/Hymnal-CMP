HYMN 625 Cross
“FATHER, FORGIVE THEM, FOR
THEY KNOW NOT WHAT THEY
DO.”
JESU, in Thy dying woes,
Even while Thy life-blood flows,
Craving pardon for Thy foes,
Hear us, Holy JESU.

SAVIOUR, for our pardon sue,
When our sins Thy pangs renew,
For we know not what we do:-
Hear us, Holy JESU.

Oh! may we, who mercy need,
Be like Thee in heart and deed,
When with wrong our SPIRITS bleed
Hear us, Holy JESU.

“TODAY SHALT THOU BE WITH ME
IN PARADISE.”
JESU, pitying the sigh
Of the thief who near Thee dies,
Promising him Paradise,
Hear us, Holy JESU.

May we, in our guilt and shame,
Still Thy love and mercy claim,
Calling humbly on Thy Name.
Hear us, Holy JESU.

Oh! remember those who pine
Looking from their cross to Thine; Cheer their souls with hope Divine.
Hear us, Holy JESU.

“WOMAN, BEHOLD THY SON”
“BEHOLD THY MOTHER.”

JESU, loving to the end
Her whose heart Thy sorrows rend,
And Thy dearest human friend,
Hear us, Holy JESU.

May we in Thy sorrows share,
For Thy sake all peril care,
Ever know Thy tender care.
Hear us, Holy JESU.

May we all Thy loved ones be,-
A lone holy family,
Loving for the love of Thee
Hear us, Holy JESU.

“MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAST
THOU FORSAKEN ME?”
