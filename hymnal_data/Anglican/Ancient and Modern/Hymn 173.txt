HYMN 173

O love, how deep how broad how
high!
It fills the heart with ecstasy,
That GOD, the SON of GOD, should take Our mortal form for mortals’ sake

He sent no Angel to our race
Of higher or of lower place.
But wore the robe of human frame
Himself and to this lost world came
For us he was baptized, and bore
His holy fast and hunger’d sore,
For us temptations sharp He knew;
For us the tempter overthrew.

For us he pray’d, for us He taught, For us His daily works He wrought,
By words, and signs, and actions, thus Still seeking not Himself but us.

For us to wicked men betray’d
Scourged mock’d in purple robe array’d
He bore the shameful cross and death; For us at length gave up His breath.

For us He rose from death again,
For us He went on high to reign,
For us He sent His SPIRIT here
To guide, to strengthen, and to cheer,
To Him whose boundless love has won Salvation for us through His SON,
To GOD the FATHER, glory be
Both now and through eternity.
