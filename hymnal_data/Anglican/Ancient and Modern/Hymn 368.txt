HYMN 368 Hospitals

Thou to whom the sick and dying
Ever came, nor came in vain,
Still with healing word replying
To the wearied cry of pain,
Hear us, JESU, as we meet
Suppliants at Thy mercy-seat.

Still the weary, sick, and dying
Need a brother’s, sister’s care,
On Thy higher help relying
May we now their burden share,
Bringing all our offerings meet
Suppliants at Thy mercy-seat.

May each child of thine be willing, Willing both in hand and heart,
All the law of love fulfilling,
Ever comfort to impart;
Ever bringing offerings meet,
Suppliant to Thy mercy-seat.

So may sickness, sin, and sadness To Thy healing virtue yield,
Till the sick and sad, in gladness,
Rescued, ransom’d, cleansed, heal’d,
One in Thee together meet,
Pardon’d at Thy judgment-seat.
