HYMN 466 No. 2

GOD the FATHER, GOD the SON,
GOD the SPIRIT, THREE in ONE,
Hear us from Thy heavenly Throne,
Spare us, Holy Trinity.

Thou who leaving crown and Throne
Camest there, an outcast lone,
That Thou mightiest save thine own,
Hear us, Holy JESUS.

Thou with sinners wont to eat,
Who with joying words didst greet
Mary weeping at Thy feet,
Hear us, Holy JESUS.

Thou whose saddened look did chide
Peter when he thrice denied,
Till with bitter tears he cried,
Hear us, Holy JESUS.

Thou who handing on the tree
To the thief saidst, "Thou shalt be
Today in Paradise with Me,"
Hear us, Holy JESUS.

Thou, despised, denied, refused,
And for man's transgressions bruised,
Sinless, yet of sin accused,
Hear us, Holy JESUS.

Thou who on the cross didst reign,
Dying there in bitter pain,
Cleansing with Thy blood our stain,
Hear us, Holy JESUS.

Shepherd of the straying sheep,
Comforter of them that weep,
Hear us crying from the deep,
Hear us, Holy JESUS.

That in Thy pure innocence
We may wash our souls of offence,
And find truest penitence
We beseech Thee, JESUS.

That we give to sin no place,
That we never quench Thy grace,
That we ever seek Thy face,
We beseech Thee, JESUS.

That denying evil lust,
Living GODly, meek, and just,
In Thee only we may trust,
We beseech Thee, JESUS.
