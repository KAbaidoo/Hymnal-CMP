HYMN 336

Above the clear blue sky, In heaven’s bright abode, The Angel host on high
Sing praises to their GOD; Hallelujah!
They love to sing
To GOD their King
Hallelujah!

But GOD from infant tongues On earth receiveth praise; We then our cheerful songs In
sweet accord will raise: Hallelujah!
We too will sing
To GOD our King
Hallelujah!

O Blessed LORD, Thy truth To us Thy babes impart, And teach us in our youth To know
Thee as Thou art.
Hallelujah!
Then shall we sing
To GOD our King
Hallelujah!

O may Thy holy Word
Spread all the world, around; And all with one accord Uplift the joyful sound, Hallelujah!
All then shall sing
To GOD their King
Hallelujah!
