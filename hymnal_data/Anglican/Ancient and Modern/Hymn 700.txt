HYMN 700

Give light, O LORD, that we may learn The way that leads to Thee,
That where our hearts true joys discern, Our life may be.

Give light, O LORD, that we may know
Thy one unchanging truth,
And follow, all our days below,
Our Guide in youth.

Give light, O LORD, that we may see
Where wisdom bids beware,
And turn our doubting minds to Thee
In faithful prayer.

Give light, O LORD, that we may look
Beneath, around, above,
And learn from nature’s living book
Thy power and love.

Give light, O LORD, that we may read
All signs that Thou art near,
And, while we live, in word and deed
Thy Name revere.

Give light, O LORD, that we may trace In trial, pain, and loss,
In poorest lot, and lowest place,
A Saviour’s Cross.

Give light, O LORD, that we may see
A home beyond the sky,
Where all who live in CHRIST with Thee Shall never die.
