HYMN 23

Glory to Thee, my GOD, this night
For all the blessings of the light;
Keep me, O keep me, King of kings
Beneath Thy own Almighty wings

Forgive me, LORD, for Thy dear SON
The ill that I this day have done,
That with the world, myself, and Thee
I, ere I sleep, at peace may be.

Teach me to live, that I may dread
The grave as little as my bed;
Teach me to die, that so I may
Rise glorious at the awful day.

O may my soul on Thee repose,
And may sweet sleep mine eyelids close,
Make sleep that shall me more vigorous
To serve my GOD when I awake.

When in the night I sleepless lie,
My soul with heavenly thoughts supply;
Let no ill dreams disturb my rest,
No powers of darkness me molest.

Praise GOD, from whom all blessings flow,
Praise Him, all creatures here below,
Praise Him above, Angelic host,
Praise FATHER, SON, and Holy Ghost.
