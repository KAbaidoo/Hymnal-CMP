HYMN 221

Let saints on earth in concert sing
With those whose work is done;
For all the servants of our King
In Heav’n and earth are one.

One family, we dwell in Him,
One Church, above, beneath;
Not divided by the stream,
The narrow stream of death.

One army of the living GOD,
To His command we bow;
Part of the host have crossed the flood,
And part are crossing now.

E’en now their eternal home
They pass some spirits best;
While others to the margin come,
Waiting their call to rest.

JESU, be Thou our constant Guide;
Then when the word is given,
Bid Jordan’s narrow stream divide,
And bring us safe to Heav’n.
