HYMN 128

The Lamb’s high banquet call’d to
Share,
Array’d in garments white and fair,
The Red Sea past, we fain would sing To JESUS our triumphant King.

Upon the Altar of the cross
His body hath redeem’d our loss;
And, tasting of His precious blood,
Our life is hid with Him in GOD.

Protected in the Paschal night
From the destroying Angel’s might,
In triumph went the ransom’d free
From Pharaoh’s cruel tyranny.

Now CHRIST our Passover is slain,
The Lamb of GOD without a stain;
His flesh the true unleaven’d bread;
Is freely offered in our stead.

O all-sufficient Sacrifice,
Beneath Thee hell defeated lies;
Thy captive people are set free,
And crowns of life restored by Thee.

We hymn Thee rising from the grave.
From death returning, strong to save;
Thine own right hand the tyrant
And paradise for man regains. chains,

All praise be thine, O risen LORD,
From death to endless life restored;
All praise too GOD the FATHER be
And HOLY GHOST eternally.
