HYMN 443

For man the SAVIOR shed
His all-atoning Blood,
And oh, shall ransomed man refuse To suffer for his GOD?

Ashamed who now can be
To own the Crucified?
Nay, rather be our glory this,
To die for Him who died.

So felt Thy Martyr, LORD;
By Thy right hand sustained,
He waged for Thee the battle's strife, And threatened death disdained.

Upon the golden crown
Gazing with eager breath,
He fought as one who fain would die, And, dying, conquer death.

Alone he stood unmoved
Amid his cruel foes; then Oh, wondrous was the might that
Above his torturers rose!

LORD, give us grace to bear
Like him our cross of shame,
To do and suffer what Thou wilt, For love of Thy dear Name.

JESUS, the King of Saints,
We praise Thee and adore,
Who art with GOD the FATHER One
And SPIRIT evermore.
