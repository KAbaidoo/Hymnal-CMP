HYMN 713

Dearest JESUS, we are here,
At Thy call, Thy presence owning; Pleading now in holy fear
That great sacrifice atoning:
Word incarnate, much in wonder
On this mystery deep we ponder,

JESUS, strong to save – the same
Yesterday, today, forever
Make us fear and love Thy Name;
Serving Thee with best endeavor:
In this life, O ne’er forsake us,
But to bliss hereafter take us.
