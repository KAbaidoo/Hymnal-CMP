HYMN 504

The LORD is risen indeed;
Now is His work performed;
Now is the mighty captive freed,
And death’s strong castle stormed.

The LORD is risen indeed;
The Hell has lost his prey;
With Him is risen the ransomed seed
To reign in endless day.

The LORD is risen indeed;
He lives, to die no more;
He lives, the sinner’s cause to plead,
Whose curse and shame He bore.

The LORD is risen indeed;
Attending Angels, hear!
Up to the courts of heaven with
The joyful tidings bear. [speed
Then take your golden lyres,
And strike each cheerful chord;
Join, all ye bright celestial choirs, To sing our risen LORD.
