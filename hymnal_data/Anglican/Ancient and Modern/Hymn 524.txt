HYMN 524

Come to our poor nature’s night
With Thy blessed inward light,
HOLY GHOST the Infinite,
Comforter Divine.

We are sinful, - cleanse us, LORD, Sick and faint, - Thy strength afford, Lost, until by
Thee restored,
Comforter Divine.

Orphan are our souls and poor,
Give us from Thy Heavenly store
Faith, love, joy forevermore
Comforter Divine.

Like the dew Thy peace distill;
Guide, subdue our wayward will,
Things of CHRIST unfolding still,
Comforter Divine.

With us, for us, intercede,
And with voiceless groaning plead Our unutterable need,
Comforter Divine.

Earnest of the bliss on high
Seal of immortality,
In us “Abba, FATHER,” cry,
Comforter Divine.

Search for us the depths of GOD!
Upward, by the starry road,
Bear us to Thy high abode,
Comforter Divine.
