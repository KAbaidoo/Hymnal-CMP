HYMN 111

O Sacred Head, surrounded
By crown of piercing thorn!
O bleeding Head, so wounded,
Reviled, and put to scorn!
Death’s pallid hue comes o’er Thee.
The glow of life decays,
Yet Angel hosts adore Thee,
And tremble as they gaze.

I see Thy strength and vigour
All fading in the strife,
And death with cruel rigour
Bereaving Thee of life;
O agony and dying!
O love to sinners free!
JESU, all grace supplying,
O turn Thy Face on me.

In this Thy bitter Passion,
Good Shepherd, think of me
With thy most sweet compassion,
Unworthy though I be:
Beneath Thy Cross abiding
Forever would I rest,
In Thy dear love confiding,
And with Thy Presence blest.
