HYMN 474 Morning

Awaked from sleep we fall
Before Thee, GOD of love, 
And chant the praise the Angels
O GOD of might, above;
Holy, Holy, Holy! Thou art GOD
adored!
In Thy pitying mercy show us
mercy, LORD.

Thou wakedst me from sleep;
Shine on this mind and heart,
And touch my tongue, that I among Thy choir may take my part;
Holy, Holy, Holy! Trinity adored!
In Thy pitying mercy show me
mercy, LORD.

The Judge will come with speed,
And each man’s deeds be known;
Our trembling cry shall rise on high At midnight to Thy Throne;
Holy, Holy, Holy! King of Saints
adored!
In the hour of judgment show us
mercy, LORD.
