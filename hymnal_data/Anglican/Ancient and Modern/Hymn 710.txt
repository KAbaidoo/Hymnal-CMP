HYMN 710

Thou Framer of the light and dark,
Steer through the tempest thine
own ark;
Amid the howling wintry sea,
We are in port if we have Thee.

The rulers of this Christian land,
“Twixt Thee and us ordain’d to stand, Guide Thou their course, O LORD,
aright;
Let all do all as in Thy sight.

O GOD the FATHER, GOD the SON,
And GOD the SPIRIT, THREE in ONE,
Hear Thou in heav’n Thy children’s
cry,
And in our hour of need be nigh.
