HYMN 683

Who is on the LORD’s side?
Who will serve the King?
Who will be His helpers
Other lives to bring?
Who will leave the world’s side?
Who will face the foe?
Who is on the LORD’s side?
Who for Him will go?
By Thy call of mercy,
By Thy grace divine,
We are on the LORD’s side;
SAVIOUR, we are thine.

JESUS, Thou hast bought us,
Not with gold or gem,
But with thine own life blood,
For Thy blessing fling
Each who comes to Thee,
Thou hast made us willing,
Thou hast made us free,
By Thy great redemption
By Thy grace divine,
We are on the LORD’s side;
SAVIOUR, we are thine.

Fierce may be the conflict, Strong may be the foe,
But the King’s own army
None can overthrow,
Round His standard ranging
Vict’ry is secure,
For His truth unchanging
Makes the triumph sure,
Joyfully enlisting
By Thy grace divine,
We are on the LORD’s side;
SAVIOUR, we are thine.

Chosen to be soldiers
In an alien land,
Chosen, call’d, and faithful, For our Captain’s band;
In the service royal
Let us not grow cold;
Let us be right loyal,
Noble, true, and bold.
Master, Thou wilt keep us,
By Thy grace divine,
Always on the LORD’s side,
SAVIOUR, always thine.
