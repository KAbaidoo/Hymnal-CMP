HYMN 485 New Year’s Day

From glory unto glory! Be this our joyous song,
As on the King’s own highway, we bravely march along!
From glory unto glory! O word of stirring cheer,
As dawns the solemn brightness of another glad New Year.

From glory unto glory! What great things He hath done,
What wonders He hath shown us, what triumphs He hath won!
From glory unto glory! What mighty blessings crown
The lives for which our LORD hath laid His own so freely down!

The fullness of His blessing…
passeth our way;
The fullness of His promises crowns ever brightening day;
The fullness of His glory is beaming from above,
While more and more we learn to know the fullness of His love.

And closer yet and closer the golden bonds shall be,
Uniting all who love our LORD in pure sincerity;
And wider yet and wider shall the circling glory glow,
As more and more are taught of GOD
that mighty Love to know.

O let our adoration for all that He hath done,
Peal out beyond the stars of GOD, while voice and life are one; And let our consecration
be real, deep, and true;
Oh, even now our hearts shall bow, and joyful vows renew.

Now onward, ever onward, from strength to strength we go,
While grace for grace abundantly shall from His fullness flow, To glory’s full fruition,
from glory’s foretaste here,
Until His very presence crown our happiest New Year.
