HYMN 555

LORD, enthroned in heavenly
splendour,
First begotten from the dead,
Thou alone, our strong Defender,
Liftest up Thy people’s head.
Hallelujah, JESU, True and Living Bread!

Here our humblest homage pay we;
Here in loving reverence bow;
Here for Faith’s discernment pray we; Lest we fail to know Thee now
Hallelujah, Thou art here, we ask not how.

Thou the lowliest form doth veil
Thee
As of old in Bethlehem,
Here as there Thine Angels hail Thee, Branch and Flower of Jesse’s stem.
Hallelujah, We in worship join with them.

Paschal LAMB, Thine Offering, finished Once for all when Thou wast slain, In its
fulness undiminished
Shall forevermore remain,
Hallelujah, Cleansing souls from every stain.

Life-imparting Heavenly Manna,
Stricken Rock with streaming Side, Heaven and earth with loud Hosanna, Worship Thee,
the LAMB who died,
Hallelujah, Risen, Ascended, Glorified.
