HYMN 48

The advent of our King
Our prayers must now employ,
And we must hymns of welcome sing
All strains of holy joy.

The Everlasting SON
Incarnate deigns to be;
Himself a servant's form puts on,
To set His servants free.

Daughter of Zion, rise
To meet Thy lowly King;
Nor let Thy faithless heart despise
The peace He comes to bring.

As Judge, on clouds of light
He soon will come again,
And His true members all unite
With Him in Heaven to reign.

Before the dawning day
Let sin's dark deeds be gone;
The old man all be put away,
The new man all put on.

All glory to the SON
Who comes to set us free,
With FATHER, SPIRIT,
ever One Through all eternity.
