HYMN 441

Let our Choir new anthems raise, Wake the Song of gladness;
GOD Himself to joy and praise
Turns the Martyrs sadness;
Bright the day that won their crown, Opened heaven's bright portal,
As they laid the mortal down
To put on the immortal.

Never flinched they from the flame, From the torture never;
Vain the foeman's sharpest aim,
Satan's best endeavor;
For by faith they saw the land
Decked in all its glory,
Where triumphant now they stand
With the victor's story.

Up and follow, Christian men!
Press through toil and sorrow;
Spurn the night of fear, and then, Oh, the glorious morrow!
Who will venture on the strife?
Blest who first begin it;
Who will grasp the land of life?
Warriors, up and win it!
