HYMN 313
Draw nigh and take the body of the LORD,
And drink the holy Blood for you outpoured.

Saved by that Body and that holy Blood,
With souls refreshed, we render thanks to GOD.

Salvation’s Giver, CHRIST, the only SON.
By His dear Cross and Blood the victory won.

Offered was He for greatest and for least,
Himself the Victim, and Himself the Priest.

Victims were offered by the law of old,
Which in a type, this heavenly mystery told.

He, Ransomer from death, and Light from shade,
Now gives His holy grace His saints to aid.

Approach ye then with faithful hearts sincere,
And take the safeguard of salvation here.

He, that His saints in this world rules and shields,
To all believers life eternal yields;
With heavenly bread makes them that hunger whole,
Gives living waters to the thirsting soul.

Alpha and Omega, to Whom shall bow
All nations at the Doom, is with us now.
