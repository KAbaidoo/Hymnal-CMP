HYMN 68 
The Innocents’ Day

Sweet flow’rets on the martyr band,
So early pluck’d by cruel hand;
Like rosebuds by a tempest torn,
As breaks the light of summer morn;

First victims offered for the LORD,
Ye little knew your high reward,
As, at the very altar, gay
With palms and crowns ye seemed to play;

Ah! What avail King Herod’s wrath?
He could not stay your avicur’ path:
The Child he sought alone went free;
That child is King eternally.

O LORD, the Virgin-born, to Thee
Praise, honour, might, and glory be,
Who with the FATHER we adore
And HOLY GHOST for evermore.
