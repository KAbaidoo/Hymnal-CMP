HYMN 181

We know Thee who Thou art,
LORD JESUS, Mary’s SON;
We know the yearnings of Thy Heart To end Thy work begun.

That sacred fount of grace,
'Mid all the bliss of heaven,
Has joy whenever we seek Thy face, And kneel to be forgiven.

Brought home from ways perverse,
At peace thine arms within,
We pray Thee, shield us from the curse Of falling back to sin.

We dare not ask to live
Henceforth from trials free;
But oh! when next Thou tempt us, give More strength to cling to Thee,

We know Thee who Thou art,
Our own redeeming LORD;
Be Thou by will, and mind, and heart, Accepted, loved, adored.
