HYMN 328

In token that Thou shalt not fear
CHRIST Crucified to own,
We print the cross upon Thee here
And stamp Thee His alone.

In token that Thou shalt not blush To glory in His Name,
We blazon here upon Thy front
His glory and His shame.

In token that Thou shalt not flinch CHRIST’s quarrel to maintain,
But ‘neath His banner manfully
Firm at Thy post remain:

In token that Thou too shalt tread The path He traveled by,
Endure the cross, despise the shame, And may the brow that wears His
Hereafter share His crown.
This hymn may also be sung when a child who has been privately baptized is received
into the congregation; and at the baptism of an adult.
