HYMN 615

Haste to watch o’er customs paid,
A man of scorned and hardening
trade;
Alike the symbol and the tool
Of foreign masters’ hated rule,

But grace within his breast had
stirred;
There needed but the timely word;
It came, true LORD of souls! from
Thee,
That royal summons, “Follow Me,”
Enough, when Thou wert passing by,
To hear Thy voice, to meet thine eye;
He rose, responsive to the call,
And left his task, his gains, his all,
O wise exchange! with these to part,
And lay up treasure in Thy heart;
With twofold crown of light to shine
Amid Thy servants’ foremost line!

Come, SAVIOUR, as in days of old,
Pass where the world has strongest
hold,
And faithless care and selfish greed
Are thorns that choke the holy seed,
Who keep Thy gifts, O bid them
claim
The steward’s, not the owner’s name;
Who yield all up for Thy dear sake,
Let them of Matthew’s wealth partake.

St. Michael and all
