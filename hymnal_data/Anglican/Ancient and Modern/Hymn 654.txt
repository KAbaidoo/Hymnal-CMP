HYMN 654 Trinity Sunday

Sound aloud Jehovah’s praises;
Tell abroad the awful Name;
Heav’n the ceaseless anthem raises,
Let the earth her GOD proclaim.-
GOD, the hope of every nation,
GOD, the source of consolation,
Holy, blessed Trinity!
This the Name from ancient ages
Hidden in its dazzling light;
This the Name that kings and sages
Pray’d and strove to know aright,
Through GOD’s wondrous incarnation
Now reveal’d the world’s salvation,
Ever blessed Trinity!
Into this great Name and holy
We all tribes and tongues baptize;
Thus the highest owns the lowly,
Homeward, heav’nward, bids them rise,
Gathers them from every nation,
Bids them join in adoration
Of the blessed Trinity!
In this name the heart rejoices,
Pouring forth its secret prayer;
In this Name we lift our voices,
And our common faith declare,
Offering praise and supplication,
To the blessed Trinity!
Still Thy Name o’er earth and ocean shall be carried, “GOD is Love,”
Whisper’d by the heart’s devotion,
Echo’d by the choirs above,
Hallowed through all worlds forever, LORD, of life the only Giver
Blessed, glorious Trinity!
