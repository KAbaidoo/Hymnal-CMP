HYMN 688

From the depths of sin and failure,
From despair as black as night,
LORD, deliverance and for light,
Use us, LORD, to speed Thy kingdom;
Through us may Thy will be done;
Give us eyes to see the vision
Of a world redeemed and won.

By the love that bore in silence
Man’s contempt and Satan’s dart;
By the longing for the lost ones
That consumes the SAVIOUR’s heart;
Use us, LORD, to speed Thy kingdom;
Through us may Thy will be done;
Give us eyes to see the vision
Of a world redeemed and won.

By the SAVIOUR’s blood that bought
By the peace His merits bring, [us
By the SPIRIT that constrains us
Now on earth to crown Him King;
Use us, LORD, to speed Thy kingdom;
Through us may Thy will be done;
Give us eyes to see the vision
Of a world redeemed and won.
