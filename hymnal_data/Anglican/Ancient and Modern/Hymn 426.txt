HYMN 426

Thou who sentest thine Apostles
Two and two before Thy face,
Partners in the night of toiling,
Heirs together of Thy grace,
Throned at length, their labours ended,
Each in his appointed place;

Praise to Thee for those Thy champions
Whom our hymns today proclaim;
One, whose zeal by Thee enlightened
Burned anew with nobler flame;
One the kinsman of Thy childhood,
Brought at last to know Thy name.

Praise to Thee! Thy fire within them
Spake in love, and wrought in power;
Seen in mighty signs and wonders
In Thy Church's morning hour;
Heard in tones of sternest warning
When the storms began to lower.

Once again those storms are breaking;
Hearts are failing, love grows cold;
Faith is darkened, sin abounding;
Grievous wolves assail Thy fold;
Save us, LORD, our One Salvation;
save the Faith revealed of old.

Call the erring by Thy pity;
Warn the tempted by Thy fear;
Keep us true to thine allegiance,
Counting life itself less dear,
Standing firmer, holding faster,
As we see the end draw near.

Till, with holy Jude and Simon
And the Thousand faithful more,
We, the good confession witnessed
And the lifelong conflict o'er,
On the sea of fire and crystal
Stand, and wonder, and adore.

GOD the FATHER, great and wondrous
In Thy works, to Thee be praise;
King of Saints, to Thee be glory,
Just and true in all Thy ways;
Praise to Thee, from both proceeding,
HOLY GHOST, through endless days.
