HYMN 754 Apostles

Let all on earth their voices raise,
Re-echoing heaven’s triumphant
praise
To Him, who gave the Apostles grace
To run on earth their glorious race.

Thou, at whose word they bore the
light
Of Gospel truth o’er heathen night,
To us that heavenly light impart,
To glad our eyes and cheer our heart,

Thou, at whose will to them was
given [heaven, To bind and loose in earth and
Our chains unbind, our sins undo,
And in our hearts Thy grace renew.

Thou, in whose might they spoke
the word [restored, Which cured disease and health
To us its healing power prolong,
Support the weak, confirm the strong,

And when the Thrones are set on high,
And judgment’s awful hour draws
nigh, [blest, Then, LORD, with them pronounce us
And take us to thine endless rest.
