HYMN 155

SPIRIT of mercy, truth, and love,
O Shed Thine influence from above;
And still from age to age convey
The wonders of this sacred day.

In every clime, by every tongue,
Be GOD’s surpassing glory sung;
Let all the listening earth be taught
The acts our great Redeemer wrought.

Unfailing comfort, Heavenly Guide,
Still o’er Thy Holy Church preside;
Still let mankind Thy blessings prove,
SPIRIT of mercy, truth, and love.
