HYMN 594 IN STORMY WEATHER

When through the torn sail the wild
tempest is streaming, When o’er the dark wave the red
lightning is gleaming, Nor hope lends a ray the poor sea—
man to cherish.”
We fly to our Maker, “Save, LORD,
or we perish.”

O JESUS, once rock’d on the breast
of the billow,
Aroused by the shriek of despair
from Thy pillow, Now seated in glory, the mariner
cherish,
Who cries in his anguish, “Save,
LORD, or we perish.”

And O! when the whirlwind of pa—
sion is raging, When sin in our hearts his wild
warfare is waging,
Then send down Thy grace Thy
redeemed to cherish, Rebuke the destroyer;- “Save
LORD, or we perish.”
