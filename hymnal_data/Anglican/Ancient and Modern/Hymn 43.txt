HYMN 43
Friday

Today, O LORD, a holier work
Thy secret counsels frame,
A king to rule Thy new made world,
To praise Thy glorious name.

Thou formest man: Thy SPIRIT
Life into dust of earth;
Man, in thine own true image made,
From Thee receives his birth.

And henceforth he dominion holds
O’er all in earth and sea;
Yet mindful whence his being came
Must humbly walk with Thee.

Alas! His wilful heart rebels
Against Thy gentle sway;
Proud dust of earth would fain be
The GOD whom all obey.

O griefs and sorrows numberless,
Which hence the world o’er spread;
JESU,
Thy mercy succoured us,
Or hope itself had fled.

O praise the FATHER, and the SON
Who saved us by His death,
And HOLY GHOST who quickens us
With His life-giving breath.
