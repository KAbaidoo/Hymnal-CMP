HYMN 152 Whitsuntide

Above the starry spheres,
To where He was before,
CHRIST had gone up, the FATHER’s upon the Church to pour [gift
At length had fully come,
On mystic circle borne
Of seven times seven revolving days, The Pentecostal morn;

When, as the Apostles knelt
At the third hour in prayer,
A sudden rushing sound proclaimed That GOD Himself was there.

Forthwith a tongue of fire
Is seen on every brow,
Each heart receives the FATHER’s The Word’s enkindling glow; [light,
The HOLY GHOST on all
Is mightily outpoured,
Who straight in divers tongues de-The wonders of the LORD. [clare
While strangers of all climes
Flock round from far and near,
And their own tongue wherever born, All with amazement hear.
But Judah, faithless still,
Denies the hand Divine; [CHRIST
And, mocking, jeer the saints of As full of new-made wine.

Till Peter, in the midst,
By Joel’s ancient word
Rebukes their unbelief, and wins Three Thousand to the LORD.

The FATHER and the SON
And SPIRIT we adore;
O may the SPIRIT’s gifts poured On us forevermore.
