HYMN 728

When, His salvation bringing, To Zion JESUS came,
The children all stood singing Hosanna to His Name;
Nor did their zeal offend Him, But, as He rode along,
He let them still attend Him, And listened to their Song.
Hosanna to JESUS they sang.

And since the LORD retaineth
His love for children still,
Though now as King He reigneth On Zion’s heavenly hill:
We’ll flock around His banner, Who sits upon the Throne,
And cry aloud “Hosanna”
To David’s royal SON.
Hosanna to JESUS we’ll sing.

For should we fail proclaiming Our great Redeemer’s praise,
The stones, our silence shaming, Would their Hosannas raise.
But shall we only render
The tribute of our words?
No! while our hearts are tender, They, too, shall be the LORD’s.
Hosanna to JESUS, our King.
