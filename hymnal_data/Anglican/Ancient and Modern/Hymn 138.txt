HYMN 138

CHRIST is risen! CHRIST is risen!
He hath burst His bonds in twain; CHRIST is risen! CHRIST is risen!
Hallelujah! Swell the strain!
For our gain He suffered loss By Divine decree;
He hath died upon the cross,
But our GOD is He,
CHRIST is risen! CHRIST is risen!
Hallelujah! Swell the strain!

See the chains of death are broken Earth below and heaven above
Joy in each amazing token
Of His rising, LORD of love;
He forevermore shall reign
By the FATHER’s side,
Till He comes to earth again, Comes to claim His Bride.
CHRIST is risen! CHRIST is risen!
He hath burst His bonds in twain; CHRIST is risen! CHRIST is risen!
Hallelujah! Swell the strain!

Glorious Angels downward thronging Hail the LORD of all the skies; Heaven, with joy
and holy longing For the Word Incarnate, cries, “CHRIST is risen! Earth, rejoice!
Gleam, ye starry train!
All creation, find a voice;
He o’er all shall reign.”
CHRIST is risen! CHRIST is risen!
Over the universe to reign.
