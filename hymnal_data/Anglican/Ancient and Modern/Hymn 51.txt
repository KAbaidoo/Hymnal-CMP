HYMN 51

Lo! He comes with clouds descending,
Once for favored sinners slain;
Thousand thousand saints attending
Swell the triumph of His train:
Hallelujah!
Christ appears on earth again.

Every eye shall now behold Him
Robed in dreadful majesty;
Those who set at nought and sold Him,
Pierced and nailed Him to the tree,
Deeply wailing, shall the true Messiah see.

Those dear tokens of His Passion
Still His dazzling Body bears,
Cause of endless exultation
To His ransomed worshippers;
With what rapture gaze we on those glorious scars.

Yea, Amen, let all adore Thee,
High on thine eternal Throne;
Savior, take the power and glory;
Claim the kingdom for thine own;
Hallelujah!
Thou shalt reign, and Thou alone.
