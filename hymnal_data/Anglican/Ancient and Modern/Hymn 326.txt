HYMN 326

Within the Church’s sacred fold,
By holy sacrament enrolled,
Another lamb we lay:
An heir before of sin and shame,
Now in the Holy Triune Name
His guilt is washed away.

O loving FATHER, Thee we pray,
Look on this babe new-born today, Thine own adopted child;
An Angel guard do Thou bestow
To lead him in Thy paths below,
And guide him through the wild.

O GOD the SON, Thou heavenly Vine,
Protect this tender branch of Thine Through all
that may betide;
Forever nourished may he be
By streams Divine that flows from Thee, In Thee for aye abide.

Blest SPIRIT, whose indwelling grace
Has given this little one a place Among the heirs
of life;
O breathe Thy sevenfold gifts within,
And keep Thy temple pure from sin In midst of
worldly strife.

So, Holy Trinity, by Thee
Divinely trained this babe may be In faith and hope and love;
So may he gain, earth’s waves o’er, His bright inheritance at last
With all Thy saints above.
