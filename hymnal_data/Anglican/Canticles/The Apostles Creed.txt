I believe in one God the Father Almighty, 
Maker of heaven and earth, 
And of all things visible and invisible:

And in one Lord Jesus Christ, 
the only-begotten Son of God; 
Begotten of his Father before all worlds, 
God of God, Light of Light, Very God of very God; 
Begotten, not made; Being of one substance with the Father; 
By whom all things were made:

Who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven,
And was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin Mary, 
And was made man: And was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate;
He suffered and was buried:

And the third day he rose again according to the Scriptures: 
And ascended into heaven, And sitteth on the right hand of the Father: 
And he shall come again, with glory, to judge both the quick and the dead; 
Whose kingdom shall have no end.

And I believe in the Holy Ghost, The Lord, and Giver of Life, 
Who proceedeth from the Father and the Son;
Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified;
Who spake by the Prophets: And I believe one Catholic and Apostolic Church: 

I acknowledge one Baptism for the remission of sins: 
And I look for the Resurrection of the dead: 
And the Life of the world to come. Amen.
