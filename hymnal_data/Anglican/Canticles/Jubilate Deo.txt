O be joyful in the Lord, all ye lands :
serve the Lord with gladness,
and come before his presence with a song.

Be ye sure that the Lord he is God :
it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves;
we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.

O go your way into his gates with thanksgiving,
and into his courts with praise :
be thankful unto him, and speak good of his Name.

For the Lord is gracious, his mercy is everlasting :
and his truth endureth from generation to generation.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son :
and to the Holy Ghost;
as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be :
world without end. Amen.
