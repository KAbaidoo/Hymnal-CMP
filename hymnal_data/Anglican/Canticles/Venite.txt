O come, let us sing to the Lord;
let us heartily rejoice in the rock of our salvation.

Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving
and be glad in him with psalms.

For the Lord is a great God
and a great king above all gods.

In his hand are the depths of the earth
and the heights of the mountains are his also.

The sea is his, for he made it,
and his hands have moulded the dry land.

Come, let us worship and bow down
and kneel before the Lord our Maker.

For he is our God;
we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand.


The canticle may end here with ‘Glory to the Father...’


O that today you would listen to his voice:  ♦
Harden not your hearts as at Meribah,
on that day at Massah in the wilderness,

‘When your forebears tested me, and put me to the proof,  ♦
though they had seen my works.

‘Forty years long I detested that generation and said,  ♦
“This people are wayward in their hearts;
they do not know my ways.”

‘So I swore in my wrath,  ♦
“They shall not enter into my rest.”’

Glory to the Father and to the Son
and to the Holy Spirit;
as it was in the beginning is now
and shall be for ever. Amen.
